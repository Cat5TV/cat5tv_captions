00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,830
why that might be
uh because that's your set spawn point

486
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
uh because that's your set spawn point
 

487
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,469
uh because that's your set spawn point
for the server

488
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
for the server
 

489
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,589
for the server
it's where i signed off when my server

490
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
it's where i signed off when my server
 

491
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,510
it's where i signed off when my server
was 1.16.5

492
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
was 1.16.5
 

493
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,909
was 1.16.5
that makes sense and what that means as

494
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
that makes sense and what that means as
 

495
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,790
that makes sense and what that means as
we see this

496
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
we see this
 

497
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,990
we see this
is that my world is still intact

498
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
is that my world is still intact
 

499
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,709
is that my world is still intact
i didn't lose my world but now as i

500
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
i didn't lose my world but now as i
 

501
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,550
i didn't lose my world but now as i
explore beyond the boundaries that i've

502
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
explore beyond the boundaries that i've
 

503
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,389
explore beyond the boundaries that i've
already previously explored

504
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
already previously explored
 

505
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,389
already previously explored
it's going to start doing world gen

506
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
it's going to start doing world gen
 

507
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,630
it's going to start doing world gen
using the 1.17

508
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
using the 1.17
 

509
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,230
using the 1.17
world gen so i'm going to start getting

510
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
world gen so i'm going to start getting
 

511
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,670
world gen so i'm going to start getting
the new caves and

512
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
the new caves and
 

513
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,350
the new caves and
uh and inevitably other updates

514
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
uh and inevitably other updates
 

515
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,389
uh and inevitably other updates
that minecraft adds to that server

516
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
that minecraft adds to that server
 

517
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,829
that minecraft adds to that server
so that means that where you've already

518
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
so that means that where you've already
 

519
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,110
so that means that where you've already
explored for instance in a cave

520
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
explored for instance in a cave
 

521
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,350
explored for instance in a cave
it's not going to update because you've

522
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
it's not going to update because you've
 

523
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,949
it's not going to update because you've
been there it's already generated

524
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
been there it's already generated
 

525
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,430
been there it's already generated
right so keep that in mind you're going

526
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
right so keep that in mind you're going
 

527
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,870
right so keep that in mind you're going
to have to keep exploring

528
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
to have to keep exploring
 

529
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,630
to have to keep exploring

as it is as i had already explored it
 

535
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,990
