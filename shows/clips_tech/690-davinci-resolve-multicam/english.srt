turn off autofocus turn off your

80
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
turn off autofocus turn off your

83
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,350
autofocus
also similarly you should turn off the

84
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
also similarly you should turn off the
 

85
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,950
also similarly you should turn off the
auto exposure on your camera

86
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
auto exposure on your camera
 

87
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,710
auto exposure on your camera
and that's going to avoid the light

88
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
and that's going to avoid the light
 

89
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,390
and that's going to avoid the light
changing but the autofocus in particular

90
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
changing but the autofocus in particular
 

91
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,749
changing but the autofocus in particular
you saw how it was phasing in and out of

92
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
you saw how it was phasing in and out of
 

93
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,670
you saw how it was phasing in and out of
focus that was the camera's fault

94
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
focus that was the camera's fault
 

95
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,390
focus that was the camera's fault
so we're going to learn how to turn this

96
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
so we're going to learn how to turn this
 

97
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,630
so we're going to learn how to turn this
one camera into these multiple

one camera into these multiple
 

99
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,950

i've already done my white balance here

i've already done my white balance here
 

127
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,630
i've already done my white balance here
let's jump over i've already

128
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
let's jump over i've already
 

129
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,950
let's jump over i've already
gone to my shot and corrected my white

130
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
gone to my shot and corrected my white
 

131
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,950
gone to my shot and corrected my white
balance using the doppler and i've added

132
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
balance using the doppler and i've added
 

133
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,830
balance using the doppler and i've added
a little bit of gain

134
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
a little bit of gain
 

135
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,830
a little bit of gain
and adjusted the offset so that my

136
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
and adjusted the offset so that my
 

137
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,429
and adjusted the offset so that my
colors are pretty good and everything

138
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
colors are pretty good and everything
 

139
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,630
colors are pretty good and everything
looks good

140
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
looks good
 

141
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,350
looks good
but i do need to now i've pulled back on

142
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
but i do need to now i've pulled back on
 

143
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,550
but i do need to now i've pulled back on
the things like the mid

144
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
the things like the mid
 

145
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,430
the things like the mid
detail i've reset that to default

146
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
detail i've reset that to default
 

147
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,030
detail i've reset that to default
because there are now two people

148
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
because there are now two people
 

149
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,150
because there are now two people
that i'm working with and i'm going to

150
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
that i'm working with and i'm going to
 

151
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,030
that i'm working with and i'm going to
have three camera shots inevitably

152
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
have three camera shots inevitably
 

153
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,470
have three camera shots inevitably
so i want to show you how to do that in

154
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
so i want to show you how to do that in
 

155
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,630
so i want to show you how to do that in
a multi-cam scenario it's a little bit

156
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
a multi-cam scenario it's a little bit
 

157
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,270
a multi-cam scenario it's a little bit
different

158
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
different
 

159
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,949
different
also you'll notice that i've removed the

160
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
also you'll notice that i've removed the
 

161
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,630
also you'll notice that i've removed the
vignette because we don't want a

162
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
vignette because we don't want a
 

163
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,229
vignette because we don't want a
vignette that's kind of weird when it

164
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
vignette that's kind of weird when it
 

165
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,150
vignette that's kind of weird when it
punches in on jeff's camera

166
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
punches in on jeff's camera
 

167
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,229
punches in on jeff's camera
and there's only half of a vignette

168
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
and there's only half of a vignette
 

169
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,309
and there's only half of a vignette
because it was on the wrong shot so

170
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
because it was on the wrong shot so
 

171
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,390
because it was on the wrong shot so
so let's get started with this um so

172
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
so let's get started with this um so
 

173
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,830
so let's get started with this um so
first thing i want to do

174
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
first thing i want to do
 

175
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,309
first thing i want to do
is well you notice that the audio tracks

176
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
is well you notice that the audio tracks
 

177
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,350
is well you notice that the audio tracks
are connected to

178
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
are connected to
 

179
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,509
are connected to
my video and so i'm going to right click

180
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
my video and so i'm going to right click
 

181
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,350
my video and so i'm going to right click
and unlink that so that my video track

182
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
and unlink that so that my video track
 

183
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,710
and unlink that so that my video track
is independent that's so that when i

184
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
is independent that's so that when i
 

185
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,110
is independent that's so that when i
switch cameras on my virtual cameras i'm

186
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
switch cameras on my virtual cameras i'm
 

187
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,910
switch cameras on my virtual cameras i'm
not going to have it

188
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
not going to have it
 

189
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,270
not going to have it
going in and out of the audio so um

190
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
going in and out of the audio so um
 

191
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,470
going in and out of the audio so um
first thing i want to do is kind of

192
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
first thing i want to do is kind of
 

193
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,190
first thing i want to do is kind of
punch in and set my framing the way that

194
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
punch in and set my framing the way that
 

195
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,149
punch in and set my framing the way that
i want it for

196
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
i want it for
 

197
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,710
i want it for
for my wide shot so this is going to be

198
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
for my wide shot so this is going to be
 

199
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,630
for my wide shot so this is going to be
my bass baseline jeff

200
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
my bass baseline jeff
 

201
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,470
my bass baseline jeff
just the the shot that we're going to

202
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
just the the shot that we're going to
 

203
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,630
just the the shot that we're going to
use when we're both talking basically

204
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
use when we're both talking basically
 

205
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,710
use when we're both talking basically
right and so i set the frame and then i

206
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
right and so i set the frame and then i
 

207
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,229
right and so i set the frame and then i
just kind of skim forward a little bit

208
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
just kind of skim forward a little bit
 

209
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,430
just kind of skim forward a little bit
make sure that we don't move

210
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
make sure that we don't move
 

211
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,830
make sure that we don't move
too far out of it and that looks pretty

212
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
too far out of it and that looks pretty
 

213
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,470
too far out of it and that looks pretty
good to me

214
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
good to me
 

215
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,550
good to me
the framing looks good so that's really

216
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
the framing looks good so that's really
 

217
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,869
the framing looks good so that's really
really simple as far as framing goes

218
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
really simple as far as framing goes
 

219
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,030
really simple as far as framing goes
but now we're not going to add a

220
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
but now we're not going to add a
 

221
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,070
but now we're not going to add a
vignette yet

222
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
vignette yet
 

223
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,990
vignette yet
but we do want to do the facial

224
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
but we do want to do the facial

retouching that i showed you last time

226
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
retouching that i showed you last time
 

227
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,229
retouching that i showed you last time
so i'm going to first create a parallel

228
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
so i'm going to first create a parallel
 

229
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,589
so i'm going to first create a parallel
node for jeff

230
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
node for jeff
 

231
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,309
node for jeff
and we're going to add facial tracking

232
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
and we're going to add facial tracking
 

233
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,309
and we're going to add facial tracking
for you

234
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319

want pan
tilt probably not zoom because the

290
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
tilt probably not zoom because the
 

291
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,870
tilt probably not zoom because the
stationary camera is not going to be

292
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
stationary camera is not going to be
 

293
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,270
stationary camera is not going to be
going in and out it's it's where it is

294
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
going in and out it's it's where it is
 

295
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,030
going in and out it's it's where it is
rotate is not necessary and definitely

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
rotate is not necessary and definitely
 

297
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,310
rotate is not necessary and definitely
not 3d and let's rewind the track

298
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
not 3d and let's rewind the track
 

299
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:53,590
not 3d and let's rewind the track
and start tracking jeff

300
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,710
face there so i want to do the same
thing to me i'm going to rewind to the

318
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
thing to me i'm going to rewind to the
 

319
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,150
thing to me i'm going to rewind to the
very beginning of the video

320
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
very beginning of the video
 

321
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,390
very beginning of the video
i'm going to create another parallel

322
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
i'm going to create another parallel
 

323
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,469
i'm going to create another parallel

now you copied from my file

328
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
now you copied from my file
 

329
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,189
now you copied from my file
instead of the main file does that

330
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
instead of the main file does that
 

331
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,710
instead of the main file does that
matter what do you mean i copied

332
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
matter what do you mean i copied
 

333
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,790
matter what do you mean i copied
well you so you i created a parallel

334
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
well you so you i created a parallel
 

335
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,749
well you so you i created a parallel
node so right

336
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
node so right
 

337
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,270
node so right
but i haven't do we're doing color

338
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
but i haven't do we're doing color
 

339
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,029
but i haven't do we're doing color
correction there's no files involved in

340
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
correction there's no files involved in
 

341
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,510
correction there's no files involved in
this

342
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
this
 

343
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,590
this
no i understand but you did a you

344
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
no i understand but you did a you
 

345
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,590
no i understand but you did a you
created a parallel file off of mine so

346
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
created a parallel file off of mine so
 

347
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,950
created a parallel file off of mine so
does that mean yours is also going to

348
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
does that mean yours is also going to
 

349
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,510
does that mean yours is also going to
have my

350
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
have my
 

351
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,189
have my
no this is parallel so it's it's like

352
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
no this is parallel so it's it's like
 

353
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,550
no this is parallel so it's it's like
layered effects

354
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
layered effects
 

355
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,270
layered effects
ah okay so i'm i'm adding effects to

356
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
ah okay so i'm i'm adding effects to
 

357
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,469
ah okay so i'm i'm adding effects to
this shot

358
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
this shot
 

359
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,710
this shot
and my main shot is this guy up here

360
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
and my main shot is this guy up here
 

361
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,710
and my main shot is this guy up here
okay so everything that i add to it is

362
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
okay so everything that i add to it is
 

363
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,070
okay so everything that i add to it is
being added to that

364
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
being added to that
 

365
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,029
being added to that
ah that makes sense yeah so i'm gonna

366
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
ah that makes sense yeah so i'm gonna
 

367
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,909
ah that makes sense yeah so i'm gonna
put

368
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
put
 

369
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,670
put
this around my face just like we did

370
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
this around my face just like we did
 

371
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,430
this around my face just like we did
with jeff

372
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
with jeff
 

373
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,029
with jeff
let's get in there so you can see how

374
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
let's get in there so you can see how
 

375
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,430
let's get in there so you can see how
much of a difference i'm actually making

376
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
much of a difference i'm actually making
 

377
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,110
much of a difference i'm actually making
on my noggin

378
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
on my noggin
 

379
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,029
on my noggin
yeah there it is this is bald and shiny

380
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
yeah there it is this is bald and shiny
 

381
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,790
yeah there it is this is bald and shiny
all right get it around there make sure

382
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
all right get it around there make sure
 

383
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,990
all right get it around there make sure
we're at the very beginning of the track

384
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
we're at the very beginning of the track
 

385
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,510
we're at the very beginning of the track
i mean you don't have to you can do

386
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
i mean you don't have to you can do
 

387
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,270
i mean you don't have to you can do
reverse tracking as well

388
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
reverse tracking as well
 

389
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,870
reverse tracking as well
but because i've lined it up to the

390
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
but because i've lined it up to the
 

391
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,550
but because i've lined it up to the
beginning of the track because see

392
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
beginning of the track because see
 

393
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,790
beginning of the track because see
if if my face moves i would need to

394
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
if if my face moves i would need to
 

395
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,469
if if my face moves i would need to
change the positioning

396
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
change the positioning
 

397
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,189
change the positioning
so there it is it's nicely lined up and

398
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
so there it is it's nicely lined up and
 

399
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,710
so there it is it's nicely lined up and
we're going to go into tracking

400
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
we're going to go into tracking
 

401
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,510
we're going to go into tracking
and hit play not the normal play but

402
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
and hit play not the normal play but
 

403
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,950
and hit play not the normal play but
this play for tracking

404
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
this play for tracking
 

405
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,710
this play for tracking
and that's actually tracking me notice

406
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
and that's actually tracking me notice
 

407
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,150
and that's actually tracking me notice
the settings are the same as jeff's

408
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
the settings are the same as jeff's
 

409
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,150
the settings are the same as jeff's
because i haven't changed them

410
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160

 

411
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,710

if i zoom out

412
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720

 

413
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,469

just continues to track

414
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
just continues to track
 

415
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,070
just continues to track
so all i'm doing here is

416
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
so all i'm doing here is
 

417
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,470
so all i'm doing here is
basically touching up my face

418
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,480
basically touching up my face
 

419
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,390
basically touching up my face

422
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
so i haven't yet all i've done is
 

423
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,430
so i haven't yet all i've done is
tracked it with jeff i

424
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
tracked it with jeff i
 

425
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,629
tracked it with jeff i
i did it on the like in real time um

426
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
i did it on the like in real time um
 

427
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,990
i did it on the like in real time um
what i'm going to do now is i'm going to

428
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
what i'm going to do now is i'm going to
 

429
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,629
what i'm going to do now is i'm going to
adjust my mid detail

430
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
adjust my mid detail
 

431
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,550
adjust my mid detail
and see how it's kind of remove the

432
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
and see how it's kind of remove the
 

433
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,230
and see how it's kind of remove the
blemishes from my face without blurring

434
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
blemishes from my face without blurring
 

435
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,230
blemishes from my face without blurring
it without making it look

436
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
it without making it look
 

437
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,430
it without making it look
overly falsified and now that we have

438
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
overly falsified and now that we have
 

439
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,469
overly falsified and now that we have
those two

440
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
those two
 

441
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,029
those two
tracking tracks look at how perfect our

442
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
tracking tracks look at how perfect our
 

443
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,309
tracking tracks look at how perfect our
complexion looks

444
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
complexion looks
 

445
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,870
complexion looks
we are just a stunning group of people

446
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
we are just a stunning group of people
 

447
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,670
we are just a stunning group of people
see that

448
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
see that
 

449
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,790
see that
so there's jeff's there's mine

450
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
so there's jeff's there's mine
 

451
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,510
so there's jeff's there's mine
now we're ready to create our individual

452
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
now we're ready to create our individual
 

453
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,589
now we're ready to create our individual
camera shots why did i do that on the

454
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
camera shots why did i do that on the
 

455
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,830
camera shots why did i do that on the
on the wide shot well this way i don't

456
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
on the wide shot well this way i don't
 

457
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,270
on the wide shot well this way i don't
have to re-track

458
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
have to re-track
 

459
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,510
have to re-track
on each of our individual zoomed in

460
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
on each of our individual zoomed in
 

461
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,390
on each of our individual zoomed in
cameras right

462
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
cameras right
 

463
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,790
cameras right
so now i've got this baseline to work

464
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
so now i've got this baseline to work
 

465
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,790
so now i've got this baseline to work
with that i can duplicate

466
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
with that i can duplicate
 

467
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,629
with that i can duplicate
and just change the zoom level for the

468
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
and just change the zoom level for the
 

469
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,589
and just change the zoom level for the
camera so i'm going to jump back here

470
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
camera so i'm going to jump back here
 

471
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,150
camera so i'm going to jump back here
and now i'm going to copy this with ctrl

472
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
and now i'm going to copy this with ctrl
 

473
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,629
and now i'm going to copy this with ctrl
c

474
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
c
 

475
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,230
c
i'm just going to jump over here control

476
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
i'm just going to jump over here control
 

477
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,909
i'm just going to jump over here control
v and then pop it

478
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
v and then pop it
 

479
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,469
v and then pop it
onto the first additional video track so

480
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
onto the first additional video track so
 

481
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,430
onto the first additional video track so
now i have

482
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
now i have
 

483
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,270
now i have
two videos that are identical but see if

484
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
two videos that are identical but see if
 

485
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,629
two videos that are identical but see if
i zoom in on this one

486
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
i zoom in on this one
 

487
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,390
i zoom in on this one
i'm going to bring this up to just a

488
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
i'm going to bring this up to just a
 

489
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,150
i'm going to bring this up to just a
little more than two

490
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
little more than two
 

491
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,510
little more than two
let's say 2.3 and bring this over to

492
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
let's say 2.3 and bring this over to
 

493
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,110
let's say 2.3 and bring this over to
jeff

494
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
jeff
 

495
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,749
jeff
and this is now jeff's camera shot okay

496
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
and this is now jeff's camera shot okay
 

497
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,350
and this is now jeff's camera shot okay
so if i turn off that shot it's going to

498
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
so if i turn off that shot it's going to
 

499
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,629
so if i turn off that shot it's going to
be back at our wide shot

500
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
be back at our wide shot
 

501
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,790
be back at our wide shot
see that okay not the greatest shot

502
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
see that okay not the greatest shot
 

503
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,230
see that okay not the greatest shot
there we go let's find one where we're

504
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
there we go let's find one where we're
 

505
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,150
there we go let's find one where we're
both smiling

506
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
both smiling
 

507
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,869
both smiling
oh i like that it's a good one there we

508
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
oh i like that it's a good one there we
 

509
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,990
oh i like that it's a good one there we
go

510
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
go
 

511
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,629
go
over to jeff wide shot so the wide

512
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
over to jeff wide shot so the wide
 

513
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,629
over to jeff wide shot so the wide
shot's great for when we're both talking

514
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
shot's great for when we're both talking
 

515
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,070
shot's great for when we're both talking
and then when jeff is talking and then i

516
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
and then when jeff is talking and then i
 

517
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,149
and then when jeff is talking and then i
need one for me too so because i want to

518
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
need one for me too so because i want to
 

519
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,509
need one for me too so because i want to
keep the same zoom level it's

520
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
keep the same zoom level it's
 

521
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,029
keep the same zoom level it's
really really easy just to copy jeff's

522
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
really really easy just to copy jeff's
 

523
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,190
really really easy just to copy jeff's
track and then paste mine

524
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
track and then paste mine
 

525
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,949
track and then paste mine
and on mine i'm just going to simply

526
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
and on mine i'm just going to simply
 

527
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,550
and on mine i'm just going to simply
move the position

528
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
move the position
 

529
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,350
move the position
to me i want to get see that thing on

530
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
to me i want to get see that thing on
 

531
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,030
to me i want to get see that thing on
the top right i want to crop that out so

532
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
the top right i want to crop that out so
 

533
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,310
the top right i want to crop that out so
i'm going to kind of position it like

534
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
i'm going to kind of position it like
 

535
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,590
i'm going to kind of position it like
that i can still see the shadow but i'm

536
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
that i can still see the shadow but i'm
 

537
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,030
that i can still see the shadow but i'm
not overly concerned

538
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
not overly concerned
 

539
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,110
not overly concerned
especially because my what is going to

540
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
especially because my what is going to
 

541
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,670
especially because my what is going to
cover that vignette

542
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
cover that vignette
 

543
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,350
cover that vignette
so there we go all right so now we're

544
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
so there we go all right so now we're
 

545
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,430
so there we go all right so now we're
set and ready to do vignettes so

546
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
set and ready to do vignettes so
 

547
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,870
set and ready to do vignettes so
we've got our wide shot we've got our

548
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
we've got our wide shot we've got our
 

549
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,710
we've got our wide shot we've got our
jeff shot and we've got

550
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
jeff shot and we've got
 

551
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,630
jeff shot and we've got
our robbie shot so let's start with our

552
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
our robbie shot so let's start with our
 

553
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,750
our robbie shot so let's start with our
wide shot

554
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
wide shot
 

555
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,230
wide shot
i'm going to click here and now i'm

556
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
i'm going to click here and now i'm
 

557
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,550
i'm going to click here and now i'm
going to add a new serial node

558
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
going to add a new serial node
 

559
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,910
going to add a new serial node
and this is going to add to our

560
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
and this is going to add to our
 

561
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,350
and this is going to add to our
main shot and we're going to create a

562
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
main shot and we're going to create a
 

563
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,030
main shot and we're going to create a
vignette so we do that by adding a

564
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
vignette so we do that by adding a
 

565
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,230
vignette so we do that by adding a
circle

566
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
circle
 

567
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,230
circle
and we're going to make that big

568
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
and we're going to make that big
 

569
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,990
and we're going to make that big
basically consider that this is the lens

570
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
basically consider that this is the lens
 

571
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,509
basically consider that this is the lens
of your camera

572
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
of your camera
 

573
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,269
of your camera
so we want it to be as big as the shot

574
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
so we want it to be as big as the shot
 

575
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,710
so we want it to be as big as the shot
and then we're going to feather the edge

576
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
and then we're going to feather the edge
 

577
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,550
and then we're going to feather the edge
a little bit with this red one here

578
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
a little bit with this red one here
 

579
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,910
a little bit with this red one here
just like that now i'm going to

580
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
just like that now i'm going to
 

581
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,150
just like that now i'm going to
decrease the gain and you'll notice that

582
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
decrease the gain and you'll notice that
 

583
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,269
decrease the gain and you'll notice that
it's making the whole

584
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
it's making the whole
 

585
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,750
it's making the whole
shot really really dark and that i did

586
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
shot really really dark and that i did
 

587
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,949
shot really really dark and that i did
on purpose so that i could show you what

588
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
on purpose so that i could show you what
 

589
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,630
on purpose so that i could show you what
it's actually doing because now when i

590
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
it's actually doing because now when i
 

591
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,350
it's actually doing because now when i
invert that selection it's just doing

592
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
invert that selection it's just doing
 

593
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,670
invert that selection it's just doing
that

594
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
that
 

595
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,790
that
on the outside of the circle right see

596
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
on the outside of the circle right see
 

597
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,470
on the outside of the circle right see
that so we've got this nice vignette

598
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
that so we've got this nice vignette
 

599
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,990
that so we've got this nice vignette
on the outside so i'm going to do the

600
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
on the outside so i'm going to do the
 

601
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,150
on the outside so i'm going to do the
same thing on jeff's shot

602
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
same thing on jeff's shot
 

603
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,269
same thing on jeff's shot
so let's jump over here and bring up his

604
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
so let's jump over here and bring up his
 

605
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,110
so let's jump over here and bring up his
color correction notice how it's created

606
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
color correction notice how it's created
 

607
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,870
color correction notice how it's created
another copy here but it's not got the

608
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
another copy here but it's not got the
 

609
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,750
another copy here but it's not got the
vignette

610
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
vignette
 

611
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,350
vignette
because i'm working on jeff's shot and i

612
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
because i'm working on jeff's shot and i
 

613
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,350
because i'm working on jeff's shot and i
haven't yet added a vignette to jeff's

614
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
haven't yet added a vignette to jeff's
 

615
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,949
haven't yet added a vignette to jeff's
shot so on jeff's shot we're going to

616
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
shot so on jeff's shot we're going to
 

617
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,630
shot so on jeff's shot we're going to
create a serial node oh

618
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
create a serial node oh
 

619
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,710
create a serial node oh
not there we want to highlight that and

620
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
not there we want to highlight that and
 

621
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,710
not there we want to highlight that and
put it there

622
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
put it there
 

623
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,509
put it there
and add a circle and jeff you know what

624
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
and add a circle and jeff you know what
 

625
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:15,990
and add a circle and jeff you know what
to do

626
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
to do
 

627
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,350
to do
that's right you go to the edges of the

628
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
that's right you go to the edges of the
 

629
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,509
that's right you go to the edges of the
camera yeah there we go and then you

630
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
camera yeah there we go and then you
 

631
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,110
camera yeah there we go and then you
want to pull your feathering out

632
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
want to pull your feathering out
 

633
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,269
want to pull your feathering out
just a bit adjust your gain we're going

634
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
just a bit adjust your gain we're going
 

635
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,389
just a bit adjust your gain we're going
to invert and

636
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
to invert and
 

637
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,389
to invert and
lower the gain see what we're doing

638
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
lower the gain see what we're doing
 

639
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,430
lower the gain see what we're doing
there look at that

640
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
there look at that
 

641
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,430
there look at that
beautiful all right now next up is
