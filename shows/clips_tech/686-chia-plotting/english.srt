00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,670
well the talk around the crypto town
still seems to be

00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
chia tonight we're looking at how to
 

9
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,710
chia tonight we're looking at how to
plot

10
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
plot
 

11
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,790
plot
and all the things you need to know when

12
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
and all the things you need to know when
 

13
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,150
and all the things you need to know when
it comes to plotting

14
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
it comes to plotting
 

15
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,150
it comes to plotting
i love it um we're actually going to be

16
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
i love it um we're actually going to be

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,830
showing you on screen
how to plot how to use delays and things

20
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
how to plot how to use delays and things
 

21
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,349
how to plot how to use delays and things
like that so stick around

22
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
like that so stick around
 

23
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,269
like that so stick around
first of all jeff can we hit a couple of

24
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
first of all jeff can we hit a couple of
 

25
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,029
first of all jeff can we hit a couple of
those questions really really quickly

26
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
those questions really really quickly
 

27
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,230
those questions really really quickly
that have come in this week yeah

28
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
that have come in this week yeah
 

29
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,870
that have come in this week yeah
absolutely

30
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
absolutely
 

31
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,029
absolutely
excellent so right off the hop elko

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
excellent so right off the hop elko
 

33
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,390

brand watched our q

34
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
brand watched our q
 

35
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,750
brand watched our q
a on chia volume one yeah and asks are

36
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
a on chia volume one yeah and asks are
 

37
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,350
a on chia volume one yeah and asks are
you saying that four terabytes for

38
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
you saying that four terabytes for
 

39
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,870
you saying that four terabytes for
plotting is a starting point

40
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
plotting is a starting point
 

41
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,069
plotting is a starting point
or is it four terabytes total oh okay so

42
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
or is it four terabytes total oh okay so
 

43
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,869
or is it four terabytes total oh okay so
i would say

44
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
i would say
 

45
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,190
i would say
four terabytes would be the very least

46
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
four terabytes would be the very least
 

47
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,670
four terabytes would be the very least
that i would have in my farm and that's

48
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
that i would have in my farm and that's
 

49
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,590
that i would have in my farm and that's
really to do with the fact that the

50
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
really to do with the fact that the
 

51
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,790
really to do with the fact that the
difficulty of chia

52
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
difficulty of chia
 

53
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,950
difficulty of chia
is exponentially growing and when i made

54
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
is exponentially growing and when i made
 

55
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,709
is exponentially growing and when i made
that statement it was in fact

56
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
that statement it was in fact
 

57
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,990
that statement it was in fact
down at about what about 150 difficulty

58
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
down at about what about 150 difficulty
 

59
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,229
down at about what about 150 difficulty
now in the past week we have surpassed a

60
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
now in the past week we have surpassed a
 

61
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,389
now in the past week we have surpassed a
thousand difficulty now you can figure

62
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
thousand difficulty now you can figure
 

63
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,750
thousand difficulty now you can figure
you know without even understanding what

64
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
you know without even understanding what
 

65
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,590
you know without even understanding what
that means you know that it's harder to

66
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
that means you know that it's harder to
 

67
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,069
that means you know that it's harder to
mine

68
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
mine
 

69
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,270
mine
or to farm chia at this point um so the

70
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
or to farm chia at this point um so the
 

71
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,670
or to farm chia at this point um so the
more

72
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
more
 

73
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,590
more
space that you have dedicated to your

74
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
space that you have dedicated to your
 

75
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,750
space that you have dedicated to your
farm the more likely you are to win a

76
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
farm the more likely you are to win a
 

77
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,950
farm the more likely you are to win a
chia coin

78
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
chia coin
 

79
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,230
chia coin
and uh if you have very little space

80
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
and uh if you have very little space
 

81
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,830
and uh if you have very little space
you're simply less likely to to win that

82
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
you're simply less likely to to win that
 

83
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,670
you're simply less likely to to win that
i think the the analogy that was

84
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
i think the the analogy that was
 

85
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,070
i think the the analogy that was
presented uh in one of our comments

86
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
presented uh in one of our comments
 

87
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,109
presented uh in one of our comments
is that it's like a lottery in a way

88
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
is that it's like a lottery in a way
 

89
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,149
is that it's like a lottery in a way
um and i said well yeah kind of

90
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
um and i said well yeah kind of
 

91
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,550
um and i said well yeah kind of
however what's different about chia coin

92
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
however what's different about chia coin
 

93
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,310
however what's different about chia coin
versus a lottery is that

94
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
versus a lottery is that
 

95
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,390
versus a lottery is that
when you buy a lottery ticket and then

96
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
when you buy a lottery ticket and then
 

97
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,429
when you buy a lottery ticket and then
they do the draw

98
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
they do the draw
 

99
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,230
they do the draw
somebody wins right right but with chia

100
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
somebody wins right right but with chia
 

101
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,710
somebody wins right right but with chia
coin

102
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
coin
 

103
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,429
coin
yeah somebody wins but you don't have to

104
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
yeah somebody wins but you don't have to
 

105
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,789
yeah somebody wins but you don't have to
throw away your ticket and buy another

106
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
throw away your ticket and buy another
 

107
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,550
throw away your ticket and buy another
one you still have your ticket

108
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
one you still have your ticket
 

109
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,910
one you still have your ticket
and that ticket is then a part of the

110
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
and that ticket is then a part of the
 

111
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,510
and that ticket is then a part of the
next draw and the next one and the next

112
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
next draw and the next one and the next
 

113
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,149
next draw and the next one and the next
one

114
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
one
 

115
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,109
one
so thinking about the size of your farm

116
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
so thinking about the size of your farm
 

117
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,870
so thinking about the size of your farm
basically think of those plots as your

118
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
basically think of those plots as your
 

119
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,230
basically think of those plots as your
lottery tickets in a way

120
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
lottery tickets in a way
 

121
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,749
lottery tickets in a way
not to call this gambling or anything

122
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
not to call this gambling or anything
 

123
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,749
not to call this gambling or anything
like that but um just to give it an

124
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
like that but um just to give it an
 

125
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,870
like that but um just to give it an
analogy that makes

126
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
analogy that makes
 

127
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,910
analogy that makes
a little bit of sense um the more plots

128
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
a little bit of sense um the more plots
 

129
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,550
a little bit of sense um the more plots
you have

130
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
you have
 

131
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,870
you have
it's like you've bought more lottery

132
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
it's like you've bought more lottery
 

133
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,630
it's like you've bought more lottery
tickets so what have you done if you've

134
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
tickets so what have you done if you've
 

135
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,990
tickets so what have you done if you've
got a hundred lottery tickets

136
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
got a hundred lottery tickets
 

137
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,949
got a hundred lottery tickets
you presumably have a more likely chance

138
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
you presumably have a more likely chance
 

139
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,309
you presumably have a more likely chance
of winning than the person who

140
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
of winning than the person who
 

141
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,470
of winning than the person who
has only one or two right and actually

142
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
has only one or two right and actually
 

143
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,229
has only one or two right and actually
this relates to a question we have from

144
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
this relates to a question we have from
 

145
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,750
this relates to a question we have from
ashrash

146
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
ashrash
 

147
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,830
ashrash
al-sabog and he says i want to ask you

148
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
al-sabog and he says i want to ask you
 

149
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,229
al-sabog and he says i want to ask you
about

150
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
about
 

151
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,390
about
cultivating chia coin okay i'm going to

152
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
cultivating chia coin okay i'm going to
 

153
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,229
cultivating chia coin okay i'm going to
start with 30 terabytes

154
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
start with 30 terabytes
 

155
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,150
start with 30 terabytes
will this be profitable after a month or

156
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
will this be profitable after a month or
 

157
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,830
will this be profitable after a month or
two will i even get

158
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
two will i even get
 

159
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,910
two will i even get
profits and what are your expectations

160
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
profits and what are your expectations
 

161
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,270
profits and what are your expectations
for the date of the pool

162
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
for the date of the pool
 

163
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,430
for the date of the pool
okay so that uh that's a loaded question

164
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
okay so that uh that's a loaded question
 

165
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,710
okay so that uh that's a loaded question
and there's two of them in there

166
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
and there's two of them in there
 

167
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,390
and there's two of them in there
well let's hit the pool one first okay

168
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
well let's hit the pool one first okay
 

169
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,710
well let's hit the pool one first okay
we know that as i've mentioned on the

170
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
we know that as i've mentioned on the
 

171
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,670
we know that as i've mentioned on the
q a in the past um they are working on

172
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
q a in the past um they are working on
 

173
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,589
q a in the past um they are working on
uh pool code right now now there are

174
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
uh pool code right now now there are
 

175
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,270
uh pool code right now now there are
some pools out there but understand that

176
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
some pools out there but understand that
 

177
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,270
some pools out there but understand that
those are like third parties that are

178
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
those are like third parties that are
 

179
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,869
those are like third parties that are
trying to get started up before it's

180
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
trying to get started up before it's
 

181
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,630
trying to get started up before it's
officially available and

182
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
officially available and
 

183
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,110
officially available and
we can't promise you that they're

184
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
we can't promise you that they're
 

185
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,790
we can't promise you that they're
legitimate and and some of them are

186
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
legitimate and and some of them are
 

187
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,869
legitimate and and some of them are
even asking for your private keys and

188
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
even asking for your private keys and
 

189
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,190
even asking for your private keys and
that to me is a big no no

190
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
that to me is a big no no
 

191
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,710
that to me is a big no no
so don't go there because it's just not

192
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
so don't go there because it's just not
 

193
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,550
so don't go there because it's just not
worth the risk so um

194
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
worth the risk so um
 

195
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,710
worth the risk so um
okay so first question is about uh i was

196
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
okay so first question is about uh i was
 

197
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,670
okay so first question is about uh i was
related with the

198
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
related with the
 

199
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,910
related with the
terabytes yeah so okay so he wants to

200
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
terabytes yeah so okay so he wants to
 

201
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,350
terabytes yeah so okay so he wants to
know profitability and

202
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
know profitability and
 

203
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,589
know profitability and
will he see you pay it in the next month

204
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
will he see you pay it in the next month
 

205
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,470
will he see you pay it in the next month
okay so again

206
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
okay so again
 

207
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,110
okay so again
not to not to put a gambling spin on

208
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
not to not to put a gambling spin on
 

209
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,190
not to not to put a gambling spin on
chia coin okay i don't want to do that

210
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
chia coin okay i don't want to do that
 

211
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,869
chia coin okay i don't want to do that
because it's not really what it is if

212
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
because it's not really what it is if
 

213
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,229
because it's not really what it is if
you're if you're just using what you

214
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
you're if you're just using what you
 

215
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,630
you're if you're just using what you
have

216
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
have
 

217
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,390
have
sure if you sink ten thousand dollars

218
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
sure if you sink ten thousand dollars
 

219
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,990
sure if you sink ten thousand dollars
into your chia farm

220
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
into your chia farm
 

221
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,910
into your chia farm
you're gambling okay we're not doing

222
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
you're gambling okay we're not doing
 

223
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,350
you're gambling okay we're not doing
that you're not doing that

224
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
that you're not doing that
 

225
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,390
that you're not doing that
um but using the analogy and taking it a

226
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
um but using the analogy and taking it a
 

227
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,949
um but using the analogy and taking it a
little bit

228
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
little bit
 

229
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,990
little bit
uh of a step further if you have 30

230
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
uh of a step further if you have 30
 

231
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,789
uh of a step further if you have 30
terabytes

232
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
terabytes
 

233
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,070
terabytes
you have enough space for x number of

234
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
you have enough space for x number of
 

235
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,030
you have enough space for x number of
lottery tickets or chia plots so you've

236
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
lottery tickets or chia plots so you've
 

237
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,509
lottery tickets or chia plots so you've
got

238
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
got
 

239
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,270
got
room for a lot well let's find out how

240
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
room for a lot well let's find out how
 

241
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,949
room for a lot well let's find out how
many so we're going to go to chia

242
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:47,959
many so we're going to go to chia
 

243
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,190
many so we're going to go to chia
calculator.com and okay so you said 30

244
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
calculator.com and okay so you said 30
 

245
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,270
calculator.com and okay so you said 30
terabytes so first of all in google i'm

246
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
terabytes so first of all in google i'm
 

247
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,470
terabytes so first of all in google i'm
going to go 30

248
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
going to go 30
 

249
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,710
going to go 30
terabytes in tebabytes

250
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
terabytes in tebabytes
 

251
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,789
terabytes in tebabytes
which is 27 type of bytes

252
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799

 

253
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,190

so we'll enter 27 into the calculator

254
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
so we'll enter 27 into the calculator
 

255
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,270
so we'll enter 27 into the calculator
oh and it changed it be mindful of that

256
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
oh and it changed it be mindful of that
 

257
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,589
oh and it changed it be mindful of that
okay so that's going to give me 273

258
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
okay so that's going to give me 273
 

259
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,830
okay so that's going to give me 273
plots so like 273 chances to win

260
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
plots so like 273 chances to win
 

261
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,789
plots so like 273 chances to win
at every time that the draw happens so

262
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
at every time that the draw happens so
 

263
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,430
at every time that the draw happens so
right now

264
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
right now
 

265
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,030
right now
as i'm recording this video the the

266
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
as i'm recording this video the the
 

267
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,870
as i'm recording this video the the
expected time to win us five months

268
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
expected time to win us five months
 

269
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,950
expected time to win us five months
that is completely arbitrary throw it

270
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
that is completely arbitrary throw it
 

271
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,710
that is completely arbitrary throw it
out the window are you gonna win some

272
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
out the window are you gonna win some
 

273
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,510
out the window are you gonna win some
chia coin

274
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
chia coin
 

275
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,550
chia coin
no go into this expecting absolutely not

276
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
no go into this expecting absolutely not
 

277
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,070
no go into this expecting absolutely not
okay that's if you're going into it

278
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
okay that's if you're going into it
 

279
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,670
okay that's if you're going into it
expecting to win chia coin then that's

280
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
expecting to win chia coin then that's
 

281
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,870
expecting to win chia coin then that's
the gambling mindset

282
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
the gambling mindset
 

283
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,070
the gambling mindset
we're not you it says that you might

284
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
we're not you it says that you might
 

285
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,710
we're not you it says that you might
get chia coin in five months it might be

286
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
get chia coin in five months it might be
 

287
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,350
get chia coin in five months it might be
two years

288
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
two years
 

289
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590
two years
it might be five years uh it's really

290
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
it might be five years uh it's really
 

291
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,790
it might be five years uh it's really
just the luck of the draw

292
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
just the luck of the draw
 

293
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,270
just the luck of the draw
so um i would just go into it expecting

294
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
so um i would just go into it expecting
 

295
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,870
so um i would just go into it expecting
no you're not going to get anything

296
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
no you're not going to get anything
 

297
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,390
no you're not going to get anything
however the chance is with 273 plots or

298
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
however the chance is with 273 plots or
 

299
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,150
however the chance is with 273 plots or
30 terabytes you could get a chia

300
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
30 terabytes you could get a chia
 

301
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,909
30 terabytes you could get a chia
chia coin or chia block which is two

302
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
chia coin or chia block which is two
 

303
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,350
chia coin or chia block which is two
coins uh in

304
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
coins uh in
 

305
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,909
coins uh in
about five months but it's arbitrary

306
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
about five months but it's arbitrary
 

307
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,430
about five months but it's arbitrary
that's not a guarantee that's not a

308
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
that's not a guarantee that's not a
 

309
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,310
that's not a guarantee that's not a
promise

310
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
promise
 

311
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,790
promise
that's not and and as i say it's

312
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
that's not and and as i say it's
 

313
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,310
that's not and and as i say it's
exponentially getting more

314
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
exponentially getting more
 

315
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,430
exponentially getting more
more and more difficult so uh just three

316
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
more and more difficult so uh just three
 

317
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,230
more and more difficult so uh just three
weeks ago

318
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
weeks ago
 

319
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,550
weeks ago
that might have said two months right

320
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
that might have said two months right
 

321
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,830
that might have said two months right
right so if you

322
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
right so if you
 

323
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,590
right so if you
plot all that right now and you have all

324
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
plot all that right now and you have all
 

325
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,150
plot all that right now and you have all
those 273 plots done

326
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
those 273 plots done
 

327
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,950
those 273 plots done
um tomorrow it's going to be it's going

328
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
um tomorrow it's going to be it's going
 

329
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,670
um tomorrow it's going to be it's going
to say

330
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
to say
 

331
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,550
to say
six months yeah right because it's going

332
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
six months yeah right because it's going
 

333
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,670
six months yeah right because it's going
that's the way it goes

334
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
that's the way it goes
 

335
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,790
that's the way it goes
yep now with the five months and again

336
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
yep now with the five months and again
 

337
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,670
yep now with the five months and again
that's

338
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
that's
 

339
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,510
that's
kind of like you said an arbitrary

340
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
kind of like you said an arbitrary
 

341
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,870
kind of like you said an arbitrary
estimate because

342
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
estimate because
 

343
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,870
estimate because
we saw within the first week of chia

344
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
we saw within the first week of chia
 

345
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,909
we saw within the first week of chia
coming out yeah

346
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
coming out yeah
 

347
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,749
coming out yeah
somebody had plotted and the expectation

348
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
somebody had plotted and the expectation
 

349
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,029
somebody had plotted and the expectation
was a couple of months

350
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
was a couple of months
 

351
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,590
was a couple of months
and they won two chia coin within 24

352
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
and they won two chia coin within 24
 

353
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,029
and they won two chia coin within 24
hours luck of the draw and everybody was

354
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
hours luck of the draw and everybody was
 

355
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,870
hours luck of the draw and everybody was
like god darn you

356
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
like god darn you
 

357
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,710
like god darn you
you know and it just it absolutely was

358
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
you know and it just it absolutely was
 

359
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,150
you know and it just it absolutely was
that luck of the draw yeah

360
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
that luck of the draw yeah
 

361
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,430
that luck of the draw yeah
so well it's like i say again an analogy

362
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
so well it's like i say again an analogy
 

363
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,070
so well it's like i say again an analogy
but

364
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
but
 

365
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,590
but
you could have one lottery ticket and

366
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
you could have one lottery ticket and
 

367
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,469
you could have one lottery ticket and
win and the next guy who has 10 000

368
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
win and the next guy who has 10 000
 

369
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,150
win and the next guy who has 10 000
lottery tickets and blew their life

370
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
lottery tickets and blew their life
 

371
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,870
lottery tickets and blew their life
savings on

372
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
savings on
 

373
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,029
savings on
lottery tickets will not win and it's

374
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
lottery tickets will not win and it's
 

375
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,230
lottery tickets will not win and it's
completely

376
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
completely
 

377
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,710
completely
you have no idea right but you can look

378
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
you have no idea right but you can look
 

379
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,270
you have no idea right but you can look
at odds and say well if i have x number

380
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
at odds and say well if i have x number
 

381
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,510
at odds and say well if i have x number
then the odds are i'm going to win once

382
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
then the odds are i'm going to win once
 

383
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,309
then the odds are i'm going to win once
every year

384
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
every year
 

385
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,790
every year
right well it's still arbitrary and it's

386
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
right well it's still arbitrary and it's
 

387
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,990
right well it's still arbitrary and it's
still just a guesstimate

388
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
still just a guesstimate
 

389
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,909
still just a guesstimate
now is that because i mean as i'm

390
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
now is that because i mean as i'm
 

391
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,749
now is that because i mean as i'm
looking at your screen i'm seeing what

392
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
looking at your screen i'm seeing what
 

393
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,830
looking at your screen i'm seeing what
the total capacity of the chia network

394
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
the total capacity of the chia network
 

395
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,309
the total capacity of the chia network
is

396
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
is
 

397
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,909
is
yeah it gets bigger and bigger and then

398
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
yeah it gets bigger and bigger and then
 

399
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,309
yeah it gets bigger and bigger and then
what your hard drive capacity is

400
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
what your hard drive capacity is
 

401
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,150
what your hard drive capacity is
compared to that so in this case

402
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
compared to that so in this case
 

403
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,350
compared to that so in this case
you put in uh 27 tippabytes and you've

404
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
you put in uh 27 tippabytes and you've
 

405
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,990
you put in uh 27 tippabytes and you've
got point

406
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
got point
 

407
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,550

that based on that mathematic algorithm

426
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
that based on that mathematic algorithm
 

427
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,710
that based on that mathematic algorithm
this is

428
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
this is
 

429
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,550
this is
how long it would approximately take but

430
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
how long it would approximately take but
 

431
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,230
how long it would approximately take but
again there's that luck of the draw so

432
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
again there's that luck of the draw so
 

433
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,070
again there's that luck of the draw so
if you're trying to figure that out uh

434
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
if you're trying to figure that out uh

look at the total network size compared

438
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
look at the total network size compared
 

439
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,270
look at the total network size compared
to what you're putting forward

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
to what you're putting forward
 

441
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,510
to what you're putting forward
uh with your hard drive space and then

442
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
uh with your hard drive space and then
 

443
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,189
uh with your hard drive space and then
go oh okay well i've got

444
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
go oh okay well i've got
 

445
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,110
go oh okay well i've got
this percentage it's ever changing and

this percentage it's ever changing and
 

447
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,309
this percentage it's ever changing and
you keep saying jeff

448
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
you keep saying jeff

number of plots because you could have

454
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
number of plots because you could have
 

455
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,469
number of plots because you could have
100 terabytes with one plug

456
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
100 terabytes with one plug
 

457
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,189
100 terabytes with one plug
but but you're because it takes time to

458
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
but but you're because it takes time to
 

459
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,150
but but you're because it takes time to
plot if you don't have a good plotter

460
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
plot if you don't have a good plotter
 

461
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,150
plot if you don't have a good plotter
you're going to take months and months

462
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
you're going to take months and months
 

463
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,430
you're going to take months and months
to plot that

464
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
to plot that
 

465
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,589
to plot that
so if that's the case and we know that

466
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
so if that's the case and we know that
 

467
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,830
so if that's the case and we know that
there's exponential difficulty growth

468
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
there's exponential difficulty growth
 

469
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,710
there's exponential difficulty growth
by the time you've plotted 100 terabytes

470
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
by the time you've plotted 100 terabytes
 

471
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,830
by the time you've plotted 100 terabytes
it's too late

472
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
it's too late
 

473
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,430
it's too late
right you've missed the boat well and i

474
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
right you've missed the boat well and i
 

475
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,270
right you've missed the boat well and i
mean case in point for myself like i've

476
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
mean case in point for myself like i've
 

477
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,029
mean case in point for myself like i've
been plotting chia now

478
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
been plotting chia now
 

479
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,469
been plotting chia now
for three weeks non-stop

480
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
for three weeks non-stop
 

481
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,270
for three weeks non-stop
uh now it started off with really slow

482
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
uh now it started off with really slow
 

483
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,309
uh now it started off with really slow
process over usb with an nvme before my

484
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319

485
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,670

um my pci card came in okay

486
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
um my pci card came in okay
 

487
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,230
um my pci card came in okay
now that i'm running uh two nvmes on

488
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
now that i'm running uh two nvmes on
 

489
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,510
now that i'm running uh two nvmes on
over pcie

490
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
over pcie
 

491
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,830
over pcie
cards i'm getting a lot faster plotting

492
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
cards i'm getting a lot faster plotting
 

493
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,350
cards i'm getting a lot faster plotting
price much faster with nvme

494
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
price much faster with nvme
 

495
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,189
price much faster with nvme
yes but i am now up to i

496
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
yes but i am now up to i
 

497
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,670
yes but i am now up to i
think it was like 62 plots okay in the

498
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
think it was like 62 plots okay in the
 

499
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,270
think it was like 62 plots okay in the
last three weeks it's really grown in

500
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
last three weeks it's really grown in
 

501
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,189
last three weeks it's really grown in
the last week and a half

502
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
the last week and a half
 

503
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,230
the last week and a half
but it's taken me that long to get there

504
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
but it's taken me that long to get there
 

505
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,390
but it's taken me that long to get there
and so if you're talking what was it 100

506
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
and so if you're talking what was it 100
 

507
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,430
and so if you're talking what was it 100
and

508
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
and
 

509
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,830
and
we're using 30 terabytes for for this

510
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
we're using 30 terabytes for for this
 

511
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,790
we're using 30 terabytes for for this
example but

512
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
example but
 

513
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,909
example but
i'm saying like if you think you're

514
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
i'm saying like if you think you're
 

515
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,309
i'm saying like if you think you're
going to plot 100 terabytes and start

516
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
going to plot 100 terabytes and start
 

517
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,070
going to plot 100 terabytes and start
getting chia like there's it's going to

518
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
getting chia like there's it's going to
 

519
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,749
getting chia like there's it's going to
take a while unless you've got a massive

520
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
take a while unless you've got a massive
 

521
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,949
take a while unless you've got a massive
system

522
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
system
 

523
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,870
system
which still yes that's not that's not

524
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
which still yes that's not that's not
 

525
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,990
which still yes that's not that's not
who we are we're not

526
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
who we are we're not
 

527
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,990
who we are we're not
we're not building that system right

528
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
we're not building that system right
 

529
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,029
we're not building that system right
because you would have to have

530
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
because you would have to have
 

531
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,909
because you would have to have
multiple nvmes and multiple uh so it's

532
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
multiple nvmes and multiple uh so it's
 

533
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,670
multiple nvmes and multiple uh so it's
just getting crazy so i i think that's

534
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
just getting crazy so i i think that's
 

535
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,790
just getting crazy so i i think that's
all the time that we have for

536
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
all the time that we have for
 

537
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,269
all the time that we have for
questions if we can move on uh because i

538
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
questions if we can move on uh because i
 

539
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,829
questions if we can move on uh because i
wanted to show you how to plot because

540
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
wanted to show you how to plot because
 

541
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,150
wanted to show you how to plot because
that is the most important thing

542
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
that is the most important thing
 

543
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,550
that is the most important thing
to get you going with chia now we talk

544
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
to get you going with chia now we talk
 

545
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,630
to get you going with chia now we talk
about using nvmes why

546
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
about using nvmes why
 

547
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,030
about using nvmes why
well you've seen videos that say oh you

548
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
well you've seen videos that say oh you
 

549
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,430
well you've seen videos that say oh you
can plot on a standard spinning drive

550
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
can plot on a standard spinning drive
 

551
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,030
can plot on a standard spinning drive
don't worry about it don't get an nvme

552
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
don't worry about it don't get an nvme
 

553
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,150
don't worry about it don't get an nvme
you can plot on a standard ssd

554
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
you can plot on a standard ssd
 

555
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,030
you can plot on a standard ssd
ignore those people okay because i'm not

556
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
ignore those people okay because i'm not
 

557
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,750
ignore those people okay because i'm not
telling you

558
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
telling you
 

559
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,550
telling you
it's impossible the statement is not

560
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
it's impossible the statement is not
 

561
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,350
it's impossible the statement is not
it's not

562
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
it's not
 

563
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,670
it's not
possible to do this you can take your

564
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
possible to do this you can take your
 

565
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,430
possible to do this you can take your
bicycle on the highway but you're not

566
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
bicycle on the highway but you're not
 

567
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,990
bicycle on the highway but you're not
going to do 120 kilometers an hour

568
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
going to do 120 kilometers an hour
 

569
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,110
going to do 120 kilometers an hour
great analogy well it's the truth so

570
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
great analogy well it's the truth so
 

571
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,509
great analogy well it's the truth so
like don't don't get sidetracked by

572
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
like don't don't get sidetracked by
 

573
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,870
like don't don't get sidetracked by
people saying oh you can do it

574
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
people saying oh you can do it
 

575
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,190
people saying oh you can do it
no listen to people who understand the

576
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
no listen to people who understand the
 

577
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,949
no listen to people who understand the
technology behind it and

578
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
technology behind it and
 

579
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,350
technology behind it and
and you're you're gonna want nvme

580
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
and you're you're gonna want nvme
 

581
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,070
and you're you're gonna want nvme
because it is

582
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
because it is
 

583
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,230
because it is
significantly faster at plotting and the

584
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
significantly faster at plotting and the
 

585
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,190
significantly faster at plotting and the
key thing

586
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
key thing
 

587
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,430
key thing
is you need to get your drives plotted

588
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
is you need to get your drives plotted
 

589
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,190
is you need to get your drives plotted
as quickly as possible

590
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
as quickly as possible
 

591
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,350
as quickly as possible
otherwise you've got a couple of plots

592
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
otherwise you've got a couple of plots
 

593
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,949
otherwise you've got a couple of plots
and a whole bunch of empty space

594
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
and a whole bunch of empty space
 

595
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,710
and a whole bunch of empty space
and that empty space is doing nothing

596
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
and that empty space is doing nothing
 

597
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,070
and that empty space is doing nothing
for you it will do nothing

598
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
for you it will do nothing
 

599
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,870
for you it will do nothing
for you until it's plotted all right so

600
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
for you until it's plotted all right so
 

601
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,670
for you until it's plotted all right so
remember that

602
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
remember that
 

603
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,670
remember that
so let's get into the plotting process

604
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
so let's get into the plotting process
 

605
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,110
so let's get into the plotting process
jeff i'm sure you've noticed plotting

606
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
jeff i'm sure you've noticed plotting
 

607
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,590
jeff i'm sure you've noticed plotting
can be

608
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
can be
 

609
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,710
can be
a little bit of a mathematical precision

610
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
a little bit of a mathematical precision
 

611
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,990
a little bit of a mathematical precision
you've got to kind of figure things

612
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
you've got to kind of figure things
 

613
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,110
you've got to kind of figure things
out right you got to figure out what

614
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
out right you got to figure out what
 

615
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,269
out right you got to figure out what
your system is capable of so

616
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
your system is capable of so
 

617
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,949
your system is capable of so
understand that if you're plotting on

618
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
understand that if you're plotting on
 

619
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,949
understand that if you're plotting on
nvme and you over saturate

620
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
nvme and you over saturate
 

621
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,150
nvme and you over saturate
the uh the nvme bus which means

622
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
the uh the nvme bus which means
 

623
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,310
the uh the nvme bus which means
it can't handle that amount of speed

624
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
it can't handle that amount of speed
 

625
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,310
it can't handle that amount of speed
then it's going to basically be like

626
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
then it's going to basically be like
 

627
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,829
then it's going to basically be like
maxing it out and it's going to slow

628
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
maxing it out and it's going to slow
 

629
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,269
maxing it out and it's going to slow
down the process so we don't want to do

630
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
down the process so we don't want to do
 

631
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:19,590
down the process so we don't want to do
that

632
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
that
 

633
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,750
that
right we want to try to find out what is

634
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
right we want to try to find out what is
 

635
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,790
right we want to try to find out what is
the sweet spot

636
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
the sweet spot
 

637
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,710
the sweet spot
for our system and no calculator is

638
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
for our system and no calculator is
 

639
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,069
for our system and no calculator is
going to tell you that you have to

640
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
going to tell you that you have to
 

641
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,590
going to tell you that you have to
figure that out and the easiest way to

642
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
figure that out and the easiest way to
 

643
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,949
figure that out and the easiest way to
figure that out i think jeff

644
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
figure that out i think jeff
 

645
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,990
figure that out i think jeff
is to simply run a single plot yes and

646
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
is to simply run a single plot yes and
 

647
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,350
is to simply run a single plot yes and
that's going to show you

648
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
that's going to show you
 

649
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,470

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,910
one day our day will come okay so under
plots we're gonna go add a plot and i'm

666
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
plots we're gonna go add a plot and i'm
 

667
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,670

plot count one uh and then show advanced

672
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
plot count one uh and then show advanced
 

673
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,550

options i'm gonna just change this to

674
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
options i'm gonna just change this to
 

675
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,870

four gigs of ram and 4 threads because

676
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
four gigs of ram and 4 threads because
 

677
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,069
four gigs of ram and 4 threads because
that's what i'm targeting

678
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
that's what i'm targeting
 

679
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,350
that's what i'm targeting
i've got 64 gigs of ram and 16 threads

680
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
i've got 64 gigs of ram and 16 threads
 

681
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,150
i've got 64 gigs of ram and 16 threads
so

682
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
so
 

683
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,949
so
now my temporary location is my nvme

684
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
now my temporary location is my nvme
 

685
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,790
now my temporary location is my nvme
drive so this is our plotter so

686
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
drive so this is our plotter so
 

687
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,790
drive so this is our plotter so
i've called it plot nvme just to make it

688
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
i've called it plot nvme just to make it
 

689
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,110
i've called it plot nvme just to make it
easy to pick and then my

690
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
easy to pick and then my
 

691
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,670
easy to pick and then my
final destination is my third field

692
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
final destination is my third field
 

693
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,430
final destination is my third field
which is an 8 terabyte hard drive so i'm

694
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
which is an 8 terabyte hard drive so i'm
 

695
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,790
which is an 8 terabyte hard drive so i'm
just going to drop it in there so what

696
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
just going to drop it in there so what
 

697
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,990
just going to drop it in there so what
it's going to do is it's going to plot

698
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
it's going to do is it's going to plot
 

699
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,949
it's going to do is it's going to plot
on my q drive

700
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
on my q drive
 

701
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,470
on my q drive
and then it's going to move to my y

702
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
and then it's going to move to my y
 

703
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,550
and then it's going to move to my y
drive so then i'm going to create plot

704
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
drive so then i'm going to create plot
 

705
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,630
drive so then i'm going to create plot
and it's going to start plotting so on

706
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
and it's going to start plotting so on
 

707
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,990

over saturating the bus of my nvme drive

732
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
over saturating the bus of my nvme drive
 

733
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,990
over saturating the bus of my nvme drive
right but i kind of want to stagger

734
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
right but i kind of want to stagger
 

735
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,069
right but i kind of want to stagger
those so that i don't also over saturate

736
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
those so that i don't also over saturate
 

737
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,629
those so that i don't also over saturate
my ram

738
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
my ram
 

739
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,310
my ram
or my cpu so i can see immediately that

740
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
or my cpu so i can see immediately that
 

741
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,629
or my cpu so i can see immediately that
that

742
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
that
 

743
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,670
that
is only using this much of my bus to do

744
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
is only using this much of my bus to do
 

745
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,949
is only using this much of my bus to do
a single plot

746
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
a single plot
 

747
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,750
a single plot
so i can easily um increase that by

748
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
so i can easily um increase that by
 

749
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,350
so i can easily um increase that by
adding more plots

750
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
adding more plots
 

751
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,550
adding more plots
so i can do that now and i'm going to

752
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
so i can do that now and i'm going to
 

753
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,470
so i can do that now and i'm going to
start staggering normally i wouldn't

754
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
start staggering normally i wouldn't
 

755
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,670
start staggering normally i wouldn't
start one immediately

756
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
start one immediately
 

757
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,670
start one immediately
but i want to show you how to actually

758
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
but i want to show you how to actually
 

759
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,190
but i want to show you how to actually
kind of delay them

760
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
kind of delay them
 

761
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,430
kind of delay them
which is kind of like scheduling so i'm

762
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
which is kind of like scheduling so i'm
 

763
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,430
which is kind of like scheduling so i'm
going to set my plot count to 10

764
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
going to set my plot count to 10
 

765
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,110

we don't wanna
 

805
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,389
we don't wanna
well you can run maybe five or six but

806
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
well you can run maybe five or six but
 

807
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,829
well you can run maybe five or six but
because once it's

808
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
because once it's
 

809
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,150
because once it's
far along uh in the process you're gonna

810
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
far along uh in the process you're gonna
 

811
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,750
far along uh in the process you're gonna
learn all this stuff as you go it's an

812
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
learn all this stuff as you go it's an
 

813
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,190
learn all this stuff as you go it's an
experiment

814
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
experiment
 

815
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,389
experiment
when you're far enough along in the

816
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
when you're far enough along in the
 

817
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,790
when you're far enough along in the
process you can it shrinks it down

818
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
process you can it shrinks it down
 

819
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,310
process you can it shrinks it down
so you're no longer taking up as much

820
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
so you're no longer taking up as much
 

821
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,829
so you're no longer taking up as much
space and it's going to start working on

822
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
space and it's going to start working on
 

823
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,910
space and it's going to start working on
the other things and move them over

824
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
the other things and move them over
 

825
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,949
the other things and move them over
so the first time you run that one

826
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
so the first time you run that one
 

827
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,310
so the first time you run that one
not only do you need to know the bus

828
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
not only do you need to know the bus
 

829
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,230
not only do you need to know the bus
saturation but you need to know

830
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
saturation but you need to know
 

831
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,389
saturation but you need to know
how long it takes so honestly let it

832
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
how long it takes so honestly let it
 

833
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,350
how long it takes so honestly let it
finish but

834
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
finish but
 

835
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,310
finish but
watch it like check in every half hour

836
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
watch it like check in every half hour
 

837
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,910
watch it like check in every half hour
and see how far along it is

838
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
and see how far along it is
 

839
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,910
and see how far along it is
and record the time that it is when it

840
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
and record the time that it is when it
 

841
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,470
and record the time that it is when it
gets to about 40 or 50 percent would be

842
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
gets to about 40 or 50 percent would be
 

843
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,550
gets to about 40 or 50 percent would be
like a really safe cushion zone you

844
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
like a really safe cushion zone you
 

845
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,550
like a really safe cushion zone you
could do 30 to 40

846
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
could do 30 to 40
 

847
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,110
could do 30 to 40
that's fine i think it's between 32 and

848
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
that's fine i think it's between 32 and
 

849
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,629
that's fine i think it's between 32 and
39

850
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
39
 

851
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,710
39
uh percent where it it switches from

852
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
uh percent where it it switches from
 

853
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,189
uh percent where it it switches from
nvme to doing ram and cpu

854
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
nvme to doing ram and cpu
 

855
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,509
nvme to doing ram and cpu
but you know i like just playing it say

856
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
but you know i like just playing it say
 

857
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,710
but you know i like just playing it say
40 to 50

858
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
40 to 50
 

859
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,629
40 to 50
so i know that that's going to take

860
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
so i know that that's going to take
 

861
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,110
so i know that that's going to take
about 120 minutes to get there

862
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
about 120 minutes to get there
 

863
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,350
about 120 minutes to get there
so that's where i want my delay to be so

864
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
so that's where i want my delay to be so
 

865
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,110
so that's where i want my delay to be so
that it's going to start plotting

866
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
that it's going to start plotting
 

867
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,389
that it's going to start plotting
and then it's going to wait two hours

868
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
and then it's going to wait two hours
 

869
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,509
and then it's going to wait two hours
then it's going to start plotting the

870
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
then it's going to start plotting the
 

871
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,629
then it's going to start plotting the
next one and it's going to wait two

872
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
next one and it's going to wait two
 

873
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,069
next one and it's going to wait two
hours it's gonna start plotting the next

874
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
hours it's gonna start plotting the next
 

875
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:16,470
hours it's gonna start plotting the next
one

876
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
one
 

877
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,310
one
i could probably even do 90 minutes with

878
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
i could probably even do 90 minutes with
 

879
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,910
i could probably even do 90 minutes with
my system because of the speed that i

880
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
my system because of the speed that i
 

881
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,590
my system because of the speed that i
see on that bus

882
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
see on that bus
 

883
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,269
see on that bus
so i can do that i can say okay delay 90

884
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
so i can do that i can say okay delay 90
 

885
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,750
so i can do that i can say okay delay 90
minutes and you're gonna figure that out

886
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
minutes and you're gonna figure that out
 

887
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,590
minutes and you're gonna figure that out
from that one plot that you ran the

888
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
from that one plot that you ran the
 

889
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,550
from that one plot that you ran the
first time

890
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
first time
 

891
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,550
first time
remember i'm i'm proceeding just for the

892
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
remember i'm i'm proceeding just for the
 

893
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,590
remember i'm i'm proceeding just for the
sake of the video but

894
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
sake of the video but
 

895
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,670
sake of the video but
i i've already run that and i know how

896
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
i i've already run that and i know how
 

897
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,590
i i've already run that and i know how
long it takes to plot a single

898
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
long it takes to plot a single
 

899
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,310
long it takes to plot a single
plot of chia so so i'm going to set that

900
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
plot of chia so so i'm going to set that
 

901
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
plot of chia so so i'm going to set that
to 90 minutes delay

902
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
to 90 minutes delay
 

903
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,069
to 90 minutes delay
i'm going to set this to four gigs and

904
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
i'm going to set this to four gigs and
 

905
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,829
i'm going to set this to four gigs and
i'm gonna set this to four threads

906
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
i'm gonna set this to four threads
 

907
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,150
i'm gonna set this to four threads
and then i'm gonna set the same drive

908
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
and then i'm gonna set the same drive
 

909
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,750
and then i'm gonna set the same drive
for my plotting

910
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760

 

911
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,230

and the same destination for my farm

912
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
and the same destination for my farm
 

913
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,230
and the same destination for my farm
field three field one and two is already

914
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
field three field one and two is already
 

915
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,269
field three field one and two is already
full there we go

916
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
full there we go
 

917
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,910
full there we go
so we're gonna do uh 10 plots but we're

918
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
so we're gonna do uh 10 plots but we're
 

919
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,670
so we're gonna do uh 10 plots but we're
going to delay each one so it's going to

920
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
going to delay each one so it's going to
 

921
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,870
going to delay each one so it's going to
start one right now so i'm going to have

922
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
start one right now so i'm going to have
 

923
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,389
start one right now so i'm going to have
two running because i've already started

924
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
two running because i've already started
 

925
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:06,870
two running because i've already started
one

926
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
one
 

927
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,069
one
and it's going to wait an hour and a

928
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
and it's going to wait an hour and a
 

929
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,269
and it's going to wait an hour and a
half then it's going to trigger the next

930
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
half then it's going to trigger the next
 

931
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,470
half then it's going to trigger the next
one and it's going to wait an

932
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
one and it's going to wait an
 

933
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,269
one and it's going to wait an
hour and a half and it's going to

934
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
hour and a half and it's going to
 

935
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,350
hour and a half and it's going to
trigger the next so by the time it gets

936
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
trigger the next so by the time it gets
 

937
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,949
trigger the next so by the time it gets
to the third plot

938
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
to the third plot
 

939
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,470
to the third plot
in my 10 it's already almost finished

940
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
in my 10 it's already almost finished
 

941
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,910
in my 10 it's already almost finished
the first one that i started

942
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
the first one that i started
 

943
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,750
the first one that i started
so we've got that kind of overlap

944
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
so we've got that kind of overlap
 

945
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,870
so we've got that kind of overlap
happening and then it's going to move

946
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
happening and then it's going to move
 

947
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,470
happening and then it's going to move
those off of my plotter

948
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
those off of my plotter
 

949
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,870
those off of my plotter
and onto the farm so this is the first

950
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
and onto the farm so this is the first
 

951
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,230
and onto the farm so this is the first
one that i started

952
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
one that i started
 

953
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,670
one that i started
you can see it's already at one percent

954
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
you can see it's already at one percent
 

955
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,150
you can see it's already at one percent
this one here is the first one in the

956
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
this one here is the first one in the
 

957
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,670
this one here is the first one in the
kind of um schedule so after 90 minutes

958
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
kind of um schedule so after 90 minutes
 

959
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,870
kind of um schedule so after 90 minutes
it's going to trigger this one 90

960
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
it's going to trigger this one 90
 

961
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,509
it's going to trigger this one 90
minutes later

962
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
minutes later
 

963
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,870
minutes later
this one so that's just going to go and

964
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
this one so that's just going to go and
 

965
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,629
this one so that's just going to go and
go jeff and

966
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
go jeff and
 

967
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,389
go jeff and
inevitably uh probably by tomorrow

968
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
inevitably uh probably by tomorrow
 

969
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,990
inevitably uh probably by tomorrow
morning i'm going to have those 10 plots

970
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
morning i'm going to have those 10 plots
 

971
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,269
morning i'm going to have those 10 plots
which is amazing so you're on that

972
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
which is amazing so you're on that
 

973
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,670
which is amazing so you're on that
kind of math you're able to get 30 plus

974
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
kind of math you're able to get 30 plus
 

975
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,550
kind of math you're able to get 30 plus
plots a day

976
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
plots a day
 

977
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,550
plots a day
i can actually show you that um so if i

978
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
i can actually show you that um so if i
 

979
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,990
i can actually show you that um so if i
bring up my plot uh

980
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
bring up my plot uh
 

981
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,030
bring up my plot uh
my farm so let's uh let's do that

982
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
my farm so let's uh let's do that
 

983
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,189
my farm so let's uh let's do that
so i told you i'm working on farm number

984
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
so i told you i'm working on farm number
 

985
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,509
so i told you i'm working on farm number
three right now

986
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
three right now
 

987
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,710
three right now
uh field three there it is

988
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
uh field three there it is
 

989
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,110
uh field three there it is
so we can just pick a date where i know

990
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
so we can just pick a date where i know
 

991
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,150
so we can just pick a date where i know
that i had it running

992
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
that i had it running
 

993
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,749
that i had it running
so here's the first of june

994
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
so here's the first of june
 

995
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,150
so here's the first of june
and you can see first first first first

996
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
and you can see first first first first
 

997
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,470
and you can see first first first first
so this is my plotter running

998
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
so this is my plotter running
 

999
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,470
so this is my plotter running
and i got let's see

1000
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
and i got let's see
 

1001
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,870
and i got let's see
i'm just going to highlight all those i

1002
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
i'm just going to highlight all those i
 

1003
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,550
i'm just going to highlight all those i
got 16 that day

1004
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
got 16 that day
 

1005
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,749
got 16 that day
okay on the 31st

1006
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
okay on the 31st
 

1007
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,310
okay on the 31st
i got 14. so no not quite 30

1008
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
i got 14. so no not quite 30
 

1009
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,509
i got 14. so no not quite 30
okay doesn't look like but still doing

1010
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
okay doesn't look like but still doing
 

1011
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,310
okay doesn't look like but still doing
pretty well

1012
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
pretty well
 

1013
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,069
pretty well
yeah so 16. all right and see

1014
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
yeah so 16. all right and see
 

1015
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,189
yeah so 16. all right and see
my system at home i'm averaging about 10

1016
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
my system at home i'm averaging about 10
 

1017
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,990
my system at home i'm averaging about 10
to 12 a day yeah it's a slightly slower

1018
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
to 12 a day yeah it's a slightly slower
 

1019
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,910
to 12 a day yeah it's a slightly slower
processor than yours and so that impacts

1020
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
processor than yours and so that impacts
 

1021
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,150
processor than yours and so that impacts
it

1022
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
it
 

1023
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,069
it
and i again i'm being very conservative

1024
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
and i again i'm being very conservative
 

1025
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,829
and i again i'm being very conservative
i'm you are i'm avoiding

1026
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
i'm you are i'm avoiding
 

1027
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,389
i'm you are i'm avoiding
any kind of crisis situation where i run

1028
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
any kind of crisis situation where i run
 

1029
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,069
any kind of crisis situation where i run
out of space on my nvme and it can't

1030
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
out of space on my nvme and it can't
 

1031
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,550
out of space on my nvme and it can't
move

1032
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
move
 

1033
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,269
move
the plots or can't create them yeah i'm

1034
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
the plots or can't create them yeah i'm
 

1035
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,189
the plots or can't create them yeah i'm
avoiding all that by just being really

1036
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
avoiding all that by just being really
 

1037
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,110
avoiding all that by just being really
like playing it safe you could speed

1038
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
like playing it safe you could speed
 

1039
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,350
like playing it safe you could speed
that up if you were to meticulously

1040
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
that up if you were to meticulously
 

1041
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,470
that up if you were to meticulously
figure out

1042
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
figure out
 

1043
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,789
figure out
where is the proper time i'm arbitrarily

1044
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
where is the proper time i'm arbitrarily
 

1045
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,710
where is the proper time i'm arbitrarily
saying 90 minutes approximately

1046
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
saying 90 minutes approximately
 

1047
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,510
saying 90 minutes approximately
uh i think i've been plotting at 120.

1048
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
uh i think i've been plotting at 120.
 

1049
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,230
uh i think i've been plotting at 120.
right so

1050
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
right so
 

1051
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,150
right so
you know i this is going to be faster

1052
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
you know i this is going to be faster
 

1053
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,669
you know i this is going to be faster
than what i've been doing in the past

1054
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
than what i've been doing in the past
 

1055
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,309
than what i've been doing in the past
right

1056
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
right
 

1057
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,789
right
but keep in mind if you start using your

1058
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
but keep in mind if you start using your
 

1059
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,029
but keep in mind if you start using your
computer for regular everyday stuff

1060
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
computer for regular everyday stuff
 

1061
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,870
computer for regular everyday stuff
it's going to impact your speed that's

1062
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
it's going to impact your speed that's
 

1063
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,069
it's going to impact your speed that's
why i've been kind of

1064
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
why i've been kind of
 

1065
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,150
why i've been kind of
playing it safe so if you know say

1066
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
playing it safe so if you know say
 

1067
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,990
playing it safe so if you know say
you're going away for the weekend

1068
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
you're going away for the weekend
 

1069
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,630
you're going away for the weekend
and you're not using your computer

1070
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
and you're not using your computer
 

1071
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,430
and you're not using your computer
maximize your plot that's a 30 plot day

1072
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
maximize your plot that's a 30 plot day
 

1073
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,190
maximize your plot that's a 30 plot day
that's right and make it happen but if

1074
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
that's right and make it happen but if
 

1075
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,390
that's right and make it happen but if
you're using your computer throughout

1076
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
you're using your computer throughout
 

1077
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,070
you're using your computer throughout
the day pull it back

1078
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
the day pull it back
 

1079
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,310
the day pull it back
you got to you got to vary that based on

1080
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
you got to you got to vary that based on
 

1081
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,510
you got to you got to vary that based on
your usage otherwise your system is

1082
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
your usage otherwise your system is
 

1083
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,430
your usage otherwise your system is
going to drag slow and i will i

1084
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
going to drag slow and i will i
 

1085
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,230
going to drag slow and i will i
will mention when i first started i am i

1086
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
will mention when i first started i am i
 

1087
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,990
will mention when i first started i am i
am vme on a usb

1088
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
am vme on a usb
 

1089
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,110
am vme on a usb
ew it was not good no

1090
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
ew it was not good no
 

1091
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,750
ew it was not good no
do not do nvme through a usb well it's

1092
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
do not do nvme through a usb well it's
 

1093
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,430
do not do nvme through a usb well it's
not truly nvme then is it

1094
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
not truly nvme then is it
 

1095
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,630
not truly nvme then is it
no it's simply usb so i ended up putting

1096
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
no it's simply usb so i ended up putting
 

1097
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,669
no it's simply usb so i ended up putting
it like i said on a

1098
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
it like i said on a
 

1099
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,830
it like i said on a
pcie one riser you've got yours on pci4

1100
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
pcie one riser you've got yours on pci4
 

1101
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,029
pcie one riser you've got yours on pci4
x4 x4 yeah so mine is not running

1102
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
x4 x4 yeah so mine is not running
 

1103
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,430
x4 x4 yeah so mine is not running
at full capacity for that nvme similarly

1104
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
at full capacity for that nvme similarly
 

1105
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,549
at full capacity for that nvme similarly
because i don't have that

1106
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
because i don't have that
 

1107
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,310
because i don't have that
spots on my hard drive yeah or my

1108
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
spots on my hard drive yeah or my
 

1109
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,830
spots on my hard drive yeah or my
motherboard i mean just looking at the

1110
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
motherboard i mean just looking at the
 

1111
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,110
motherboard i mean just looking at the
usb thing because some people are

1112
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
usb thing because some people are
 

1113
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,470
usb thing because some people are
probably thinking oh well

1114
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
probably thinking oh well
 

1115
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,470
probably thinking oh well
you know usb with uas is going to give

1116
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
you know usb with uas is going to give
 

1117
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,750
you know usb with uas is going to give
me up to

1118
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
me up to
 

1119
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,909
me up to
you know five gigabits a second if it's

1120
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
you know five gigabits a second if it's
 

1121
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,830
you know five gigabits a second if it's
usb 3.

1122
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
usb 3.
 

1123
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,270
usb 3.
yeah but remember see i'm moving really

1124
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
yeah but remember see i'm moving really
 

1125
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,710
yeah but remember see i'm moving really
really fast here but gigabits

1126
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
really fast here but gigabits
 

1127
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,230
really fast here but gigabits
per second right remember that the

1128
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
per second right remember that the
 

1129
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,590
per second right remember that the
measurements are different so when you

1130
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
measurements are different so when you
 

1131
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,590
measurements are different so when you
look at the speed of an nvme drive

1132
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
look at the speed of an nvme drive
 

1133
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,029
look at the speed of an nvme drive
at 2 000 megabytes

1134
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
at 2 000 megabytes
 

1135
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,110
at 2 000 megabytes
per second and you think that you're oh

1136
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
per second and you think that you're oh
 

1137
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,150
per second and you think that you're oh
well i've got a

1138
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
well i've got a
 

1139
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,669
well i've got a
five gigabit usb well five gigabits is

1140
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
five gigabit usb well five gigabits is
 

1141
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,230
five gigabit usb well five gigabits is
only 620 something

1142
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
only 620 something
 

1143
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,190
only 620 something
megabytes yep right so it's a completely

1144
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
megabytes yep right so it's a completely
 

1145
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,549
megabytes yep right so it's a completely
different measurement you got to convert

1146
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
different measurement you got to convert
 

1147
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,110
different measurement you got to convert
that

1148
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
that
 

1149
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,310
that
same reason i'm converting from

1150
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
same reason i'm converting from
 

1151
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,470
same reason i'm converting from
terabytes to tebibytes

1152
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
terabytes to tebibytes
 

1153
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,510
terabytes to tebibytes
right because it's not the same

1154
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
right because it's not the same
 

1155
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,590
right because it's not the same
measurement even if it has a similar

1156
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
measurement even if it has a similar
 

1157
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,070
measurement even if it has a similar
acronym so that's all the time that we

1158
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
acronym so that's all the time that we
 

1159
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,870
acronym so that's all the time that we
have remember

1160
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
have remember
 

1161
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,190
have remember
uh plotting is very complex i understand

1162
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
uh plotting is very complex i understand
 

1163
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,789
uh plotting is very complex i understand
that jeff understands that

1164
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
that jeff understands that
 

1165
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,630
that jeff understands that
but we're pretty far along in our

1166
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
but we're pretty far along in our
 

1167
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,630
but we're pretty far along in our
understanding on how it works and how to

1168
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
understanding on how it works and how to
 

1169
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,950
understanding on how it works and how to
maximize the performance of our plotter

1170
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
maximize the performance of our plotter
 

1171
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,029
maximize the performance of our plotter
and we're going to be looking at farming

1172
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
and we're going to be looking at farming
 

1173
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,549
and we're going to be looking at farming
as well on a raspberry pi

1174
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
as well on a raspberry pi
 

1175
