we ran out of time last time

8
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
we ran out of time last time
 

9
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,430
we ran out of time last time
but uh you've got more questions for me

10
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
but uh you've got more questions for me
 

11
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,870
but uh you've got more questions for me
let's do it somebody says i'm trying to

12
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
let's do it somebody says i'm trying to
 

13
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,549
let's do it somebody says i'm trying to
do my first plots

14
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
do my first plots
 

15
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,910
do my first plots
but i don't understand what all the

16
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
but i don't understand what all the
 

17
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,230
but i don't understand what all the
settings mean i've tried doing just 10

18
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
settings mean i've tried doing just 10
 

19
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,510
settings mean i've tried doing just 10
plots and it said i don't have enough

20
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
plots and it said i don't have enough
 

21
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,109
plots and it said i don't have enough
space on my drive but it's two terabytes

22
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
space on my drive but it's two terabytes
 

23
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,630
space on my drive but it's two terabytes
and this goes back to the storage space

24
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
and this goes back to the storage space
 

25
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,910
and this goes back to the storage space
that we're talking about earlier uh

26
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
that we're talking about earlier uh
 

27
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,470
that we're talking about earlier uh
the nvme space for the uh yeah the

28
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
the nvme space for the uh yeah the
 

29
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,910
the nvme space for the uh yeah the
temporary so they're saying it's two

30
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
temporary so they're saying it's two
 

31
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,790
temporary so they're saying it's two
terabytes

32
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
terabytes
 

33
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,390
terabytes
and i read somewhere that shia plots are

34
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
and i read somewhere that shia plots are
 

35
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,070
and i read somewhere that shia plots are
only about 100 gigs each

36
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
only about 100 gigs each
 

37
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,270
only about 100 gigs each
so i'm lost why is it that i can't do 10

38
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
so i'm lost why is it that i can't do 10
 

39
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,950
so i'm lost why is it that i can't do 10
ah interesting okay i'm going to bring

40
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
ah interesting okay i'm going to bring
 

41
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,110
ah interesting okay i'm going to bring
up my screen here okay

42
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
up my screen here okay
 

43
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,470
up my screen here okay
what this user is encountering is

44
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
what this user is encountering is
 

45
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,229
what this user is encountering is
they're adding a plot and they see it's

46
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
they're adding a plot and they see it's
 

47
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,030
they're adding a plot and they see it's
101 gigabytes they're seeing it as

48
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
101 gigabytes they're seeing it as
 

49
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,029
101 gigabytes they're seeing it as
but that's actually give a gibabytes

50
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
but that's actually give a gibabytes
 

51
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,549
but that's actually give a gibabytes
which is hard for me to say but it is a

52
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
which is hard for me to say but it is a
 

53
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,110
which is hard for me to say but it is a
word

54
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
word
 

55
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,150
word
um and they're setting this to 10. so

56
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
um and they're setting this to 10. so
 

57
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,510
um and they're setting this to 10. so
thinking that okay 101 times 10 is going

58
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
thinking that okay 101 times 10 is going
 

59
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,750
thinking that okay 101 times 10 is going
to be about a terabyte

60
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
to be about a terabyte
 

61
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,150
to be about a terabyte
and they have a 2 terabyte nvme so it

62
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
and they have a 2 terabyte nvme so it
 

63
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,349
and they have a 2 terabyte nvme so it
should work if they plot that in

64
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
should work if they plot that in
 

65
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,470
should work if they plot that in
parallel right

66
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
parallel right
 

67
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,590
parallel right
uh well uh now note that this is give

68
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
uh well uh now note that this is give
 

69
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,789
uh well uh now note that this is give
giveabytes not gigabytes okay and the

70
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
giveabytes not gigabytes okay and the
 

71
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,789
giveabytes not gigabytes okay and the
temporary space required

72
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
temporary space required
 

73
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,830
temporary space required
per plot is

74
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
per plot is
 

75
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,950
per plot is
gigabytes so a quick way to figure this

76
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
gigabytes so a quick way to figure this
 

77
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,550
gigabytes so a quick way to figure this
out i'm going to go into google

78
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
out i'm going to go into google
 

79
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,590
out i'm going to go into google
and say 239 gigabytes

80
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
and say 239 gigabytes
 

81
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,910
and say 239 gigabytes
to gigabytes that is going to be 256

82
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
to gigabytes that is going to be 256
 

83
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,270
to gigabytes that is going to be 256
gigabytes per plot and

84
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
gigabytes per plot and
 

85
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,109
gigabytes per plot and
we're doing 10 plots at once so that

86
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
we're doing 10 plots at once so that
 

87
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,590
we're doing 10 plots at once so that
requires

88
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,600

 

89
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,830

2566.24

90
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
2566.24
 

91
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,190
2566.24
gigabytes uh convert that to terabytes

92
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
gigabytes uh convert that to terabytes
 

93
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,149
gigabytes uh convert that to terabytes
and that requires a 2.6 terabyte drive

94
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
and that requires a 2.6 terabyte drive
 

95
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,749
and that requires a 2.6 terabyte drive
so you're actually exceeding

96
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
so you're actually exceeding
 

97
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,389
so you're actually exceeding
the capacity of your nvme right there so

98
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
the capacity of your nvme right there so
 

99
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,749
the capacity of your nvme right there so
when you're when you're setting up your

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,390
to performance which is going to give us
fewer plots per run but it's going to be

162
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
fewer plots per run but it's going to be
 

163
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,869
fewer plots per run but it's going to be
faster well if i want to maximize my

164
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
faster well if i want to maximize my
 

165
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,550
faster well if i want to maximize my
output i can go with the most number of

166
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
output i can go with the most number of
 

167
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,430
output i can go with the most number of
plots per run

168
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
plots per run
 

169
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,350
plots per run
and the slowest and that's going to give

170
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
and the slowest and that's going to give
 

171
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,270
and the slowest and that's going to give
me 7 on your 2 terabyte

172
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
me 7 on your 2 terabyte
 

173
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,670
me 7 on your 2 terabyte
okay so follow those settings and you'll

174
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
okay so follow those settings and you'll
 

175
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,509
okay so follow those settings and you'll
be able to actually maximize

176
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
be able to actually maximize
 

177
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,550
be able to actually maximize
how much you're able to do but you

178
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
how much you're able to do but you
 

179
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,790
how much you're able to do but you
notice that 10 it's nowhere near 10 it's

180
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
notice that 10 it's nowhere near 10 it's
 

181
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,710
notice that 10 it's nowhere near 10 it's
seven is the absolute maximum

182
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
seven is the absolute maximum
 

183
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,190
seven is the absolute maximum
that you're able to do right okay now as

184
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
that you're able to do right okay now as
 

185
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,670
that you're able to do right okay now as
far as the performance versus

186
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
far as the performance versus
 

187
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,790
far as the performance versus
maximum capacity is there a sweet spot

188
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
maximum capacity is there a sweet spot
 

189
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,350
maximum capacity is there a sweet spot
in that

190
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
in that
 

191
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,430
in that
like it's hard to calculate yourself

192
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
like it's hard to calculate yourself
 

193
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,110
like it's hard to calculate yourself
right because you're going to be doing a

194
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
right because you're going to be doing a
 

195
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,149
right because you're going to be doing a
lot of testing

196
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
lot of testing
 

197
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,229
lot of testing
so under use of computer in our

198
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
so under use of computer in our
 

199
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,149
so under use of computer in our
calculator you can change it to

200
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
calculator you can change it to
 

201
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,830
calculator you can change it to
balanced so that you can still use your

202
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
balanced so that you can still use your
 

203
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,190
balanced so that you can still use your
computer system for example

204
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
computer system for example
 

205
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,990
computer system for example
which basically relieved it of one plot

206
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
which basically relieved it of one plot
 

207
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,270
which basically relieved it of one plot
so that's going to give us a couple of

208
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
so that's going to give us a couple of
 

209
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,990
so that's going to give us a couple of
well one

210
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
well one
 

211
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,229
well one

and i can keep working on my computer

220
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
and i can keep working on my computer
 

221
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,869
and i can keep working on my computer
it's only going to plot three plots at a

222
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
it's only going to plot three plots at a
 

223
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,470
it's only going to plot three plots at a
time but it's going to be able to find

settings sure
 

243
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,030
settings sure
absolutely because those settings do

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
it just doesn't work yeah now when it
 

257
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,789
it just doesn't work yeah now when it
comes to mining cryptocurrency there's

258
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
comes to mining cryptocurrency there's
 

259
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,390
comes to mining cryptocurrency there's
been a lot of

260
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
been a lot of
 

261
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,430
been a lot of
talk about some of the some of the coins

262

chia says that they are environmentally
 

267
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,469
chia says that they are environmentally
friendly they do say this jeff

268
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
friendly they do say this jeff
 

269
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,070
friendly they do say this jeff
but there are some on youtube that's

270
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
but there are some on youtube that's
 

271
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,390
but there are some on youtube that's
saying that that's hogwash

272
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
saying that that's hogwash
 

273
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,749
saying that that's hogwash
and it's actually just as bad

274
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
and it's actually just as bad
 

275
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,790
and it's actually just as bad
environmentally as some of the more

276
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
environmentally as some of the more
 

277
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,230
environmentally as some of the more
well-known cryptocurrencies

well-known cryptocurrencies
 

279
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,070
well-known cryptocurrencies
right so is that true is it

280
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
right so is that true is it
 

281
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,430
right so is that true is it
environmentally friendly because my

282
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
environmentally friendly because my
 

283
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,990
environmentally friendly because my
thought is

284
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
thought is
 

285
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,350
thought is
if you can do it on a single board

286
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
if you can do it on a single board
 

287
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,670
if you can do it on a single board
computer that's so much less on energy

288
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
computer that's so much less on energy
 

289
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,070
computer that's so much less on energy
pull

290
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
pull
 

291
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,990
pull
i think the statement jeff um that i

292
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
i think the statement jeff um that i
 

293
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,189
i think the statement jeff um that i
have heard

294
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
have heard
 

295
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,189
have heard
about some people saying that it's just

296
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
about some people saying that it's just
 

297
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,749
about some people saying that it's just
as bad as proof of work or it is proof

298
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
as bad as proof of work or it is proof
 

299
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,550
as bad as proof of work or it is proof
of work

300
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
of work
 

301
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,390
of work
they are looking at the plotting process

302
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
they are looking at the plotting process
 

303
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,150
they are looking at the plotting process
so we again backing up to our first

304
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
so we again backing up to our first
 

305
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,629
so we again backing up to our first
question

306
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
question
 

307
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,390
question
understanding the difference between

308
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
understanding the difference between
 

309
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,150
understanding the difference between
plotting and farming

310
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
plotting and farming
 

311
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,350
plotting and farming
so the plotting process well

312
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
so the plotting process well
 

313
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,629
so the plotting process well
when you're watching these videos or

and things
 

319
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,629
and things
understand that if the person that

320
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
understand that if the person that
 

321
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,230
understand that if the person that
you're observing

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,350
you're observing
is setting up petabytes of storage and

324
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
is setting up petabytes of storage and
 

325
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,749
is setting up petabytes of storage and
they

326
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
they
 

327
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,749
they
are creating a plotter that has 200 mvme

328
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
are creating a plotter that has 200 mvme
 

329
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,670
are creating a plotter that has 200 mvme
drives and they're all set up in a raid

330
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
drives and they're all set up in a raid
 

331
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,950
drives and they're all set up in a raid
like they are that is they're

332
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
like they are that is they're
 

333
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,550
like they are that is they're
more than a farm like they are like a

334
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
more than a farm like they are like a
 

335
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,870
more than a farm like they are like a
factory farm okay

336
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
factory farm okay
 

337
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,110
factory farm okay
so understand that now what we're doing

338
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
so understand that now what we're doing
 

339
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,110
so understand that now what we're doing
is completely different because

340
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
is completely different because
 

341
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,749
is completely different because
understand that the proof-of-work aspect

342
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
understand that the proof-of-work aspect
 

343
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,230
understand that the proof-of-work aspect
of

344
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
of
 

345
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,670
of
chia is just the plotting process

346
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
chia is just the plotting process
 

347
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,270
chia is just the plotting process
if you want to call it proof of work

348
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
if you want to call it proof of work
 

349
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,950
if you want to call it proof of work
it's not technically

350
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
it's not technically
 

351
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,629
it's not technically
but it is you know that's the time

352
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
but it is you know that's the time
 

353
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,629
but it is you know that's the time
component and it does use cpu

354
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
component and it does use cpu
 

355
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,110
component and it does use cpu
and and uh i o and ram not gpu

356
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
and and uh i o and ram not gpu
 

357
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,590
and and uh i o and ram not gpu
so if they say it's not environmentally

358
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
so if they say it's not environmentally
 

359
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,230
so if they say it's not environmentally
friendly

360
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
friendly
 

361
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,830

they are referring and when we say

362
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
they are referring and when we say
 

363
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,950
they are referring and when we say
environmentally friendly we're talking

364
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
environmentally friendly we're talking
 

365
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,390
environmentally friendly we're talking
about like energy consumption

366
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
about like energy consumption
 

367
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,909
about like energy consumption
heat generated all that kind of stuff

368
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
heat generated all that kind of stuff
 

369
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,909
heat generated all that kind of stuff
it's not like it it doesn't spew things

370
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
it's not like it it doesn't spew things
 

371
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,350
it's not like it it doesn't spew things
into the atmosphere right

372
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
into the atmosphere right
 

373
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,510
into the atmosphere right
but just like crypto you know the proof

374
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
but just like crypto you know the proof
 

375
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,270
but just like crypto you know the proof
of work cryptos like bitcoin

376
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
of work cryptos like bitcoin

um that's they're referring to the

378
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
um that's they're referring to the
 

379
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,950
um that's they're referring to the
plotting process

380
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
plotting process
 

381
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,230
plotting process
in our scale so we're we've got a hard

382
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
in our scale so we're we've got a hard
 

383
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,670
in our scale so we're we've got a hard
drive connected to a raspberry pi that

384
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
drive connected to a raspberry pi that
 

385
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,870
drive connected to a raspberry pi that
we're going to farm on

386
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
we're going to farm on
 

387
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,150
we're going to farm on
we are plotting until that hard drive is

388
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
we are plotting until that hard drive is
 

389
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,550
we are plotting until that hard drive is
full

390
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
full
 

391
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,270
full
on our farm once that hard drive has as

392
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
on our farm once that hard drive has as
 

393
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,950
on our farm once that hard drive has as
many plots as it can take

394
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
many plots as it can take
 

395
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,189
many plots as it can take
and our calculator will tell you so your

396
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
and our calculator will tell you so your
 

397
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,110
and our calculator will tell you so your
your 8 terabyte drive can take

398
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
your 8 terabyte drive can take
 

399
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,390
your 8 terabyte drive can take
75 plots okay so once i've created 75

400
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
75 plots okay so once i've created 75
 

401
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,670
75 plots okay so once i've created 75
plots on that drive

402
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
plots on that drive
 

403
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,710
plots on that drive
i stopped plotting i'm done now

404
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
i stopped plotting i'm done now
 

405
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,830
i stopped plotting i'm done now

you move those onto your farm and then

442
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
you move those onto your farm and then
 

443
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,950
you move those onto your farm and then
the farm is extremely

444
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
the farm is extremely

chia blockchain software right now
 

543
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,910
chia blockchain software right now
now will it be adopted by um by other

544
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
now will it be adopted by um by other
 

545
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,870
now will it be adopted by um by other
wallet software

546
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
wallet software
 

547
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,910
wallet software
probably uh yeah i would expect so

548
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
probably uh yeah i would expect so
 

549
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,829
probably uh yeah i would expect so
keep in mind that chia is open source

550
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
keep in mind that chia is open source
 

551
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,030
keep in mind that chia is open source
and you know that's

552
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
and you know that's
 

553
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,030
and you know that's
that's likely going to happen but right

554
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
that's likely going to happen but right
 

555
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,630
that's likely going to happen but right
now it's very very new

556
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
now it's very very new
 

557
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,269
now it's very very new
so there's not third party integration i

558
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
so there's not third party integration i
 

559
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,550
so there's not third party integration i
i don't know of any

i don't know of any
um any uh exchanges that are currently

um any uh exchanges that are currently
carrying it

564
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
carrying it
 

565
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,750
carrying it
etc etc and the wallet is going to be

566
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
etc etc and the wallet is going to be

the chia blockchain software right okay

568
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
the chia blockchain software right okay
 

569
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,790
the chia blockchain software right okay
um and as far as

570
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
um and as far as
 

571
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,470
um and as far as
you know the investment cost because

572
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
you know the investment cost because
 

573
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,230
you know the investment cost because
you've talked about mvmes and

574
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
you've talked about mvmes and
 

575
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,190
you've talked about mvmes and
you know you're going to burn one of

576
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
you know you're going to burn one of
 

577
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,269
you know you're going to burn one of
those out in the hard drive space one at

578
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
those out in the hard drive space one at
 

579
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:33,750
those out in the hard drive space one at
least

580
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
least
 

581
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,949
least
yeah is there kind of a sweet spot

582
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
yeah is there kind of a sweet spot
 

583
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,509
yeah is there kind of a sweet spot
between

584
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
between
 

585
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,949
between
investment versus potential profit

586
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
investment versus potential profit
 

587
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,590
investment versus potential profit
there's there's a big fine line between

588
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
there's there's a big fine line between
 

589
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,310
there's there's a big fine line between
investing

590
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
investing
 

591
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,990
investing
and just simply farming chia

592
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
and just simply farming chia
 

593
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,550
and just simply farming chia
i would suggest i mean if you're just

594
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
i would suggest i mean if you're just
 

595
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,949
i would suggest i mean if you're just
the average joe consumer like me

596
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
the average joe consumer like me
 

597
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,870
the average joe consumer like me
just grab some stuff that you got

598
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
just grab some stuff that you got
 

599
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,990
just grab some stuff that you got
kicking around

600
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
kicking around
 

601
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,230
kicking around
you might have to buy an nvme drive i

602
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
you might have to buy an nvme drive i
 

603
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,190
you might have to buy an nvme drive i
happen to have

604
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
happen to have
 

605
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,190
happen to have
a two terabyte nvme drive that i can

606
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
a two terabyte nvme drive that i can
 

607
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,870
a two terabyte nvme drive that i can
burn through and that's okay

608
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
burn through and that's okay
 

609
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,710
burn through and that's okay
uh if you don't you might have to buy

610
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
uh if you don't you might have to buy
 

611
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,990
uh if you don't you might have to buy
that but

612
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
that but
 

613
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,790
that but
uh and a little bit extra hardware just

614
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
uh and a little bit extra hardware just
 

615
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,910
uh and a little bit extra hardware just
use what you have

616
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
use what you have
 

617
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,829
use what you have
um jeff you were asking about like how

618
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
um jeff you were asking about like how
 

619
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,269
um jeff you were asking about like how
big of a hard drive should i have and

620
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
big of a hard drive should i have and
 

621
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,150
big of a hard drive should i have and
and i think if you've got a four

622
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
and i think if you've got a four
 

623
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,910
and i think if you've got a four
terabyte hard drive kicking around

624
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
terabyte hard drive kicking around
 

625
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,150
terabyte hard drive kicking around
which most of us do at this point maybe

626
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
which most of us do at this point maybe
 

627
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,670
which most of us do at this point maybe
you can pull it from something

628
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
you can pull it from something
 

629
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,910
you can pull it from something
um you'd probably be okay to start with

630
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
um you'd probably be okay to start with
 

631
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,069
um you'd probably be okay to start with
that you could start with a one terabyte

632
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
that you could start with a one terabyte
 

633
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,590
that you could start with a one terabyte
and you're going to plot it

634
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
and you're going to plot it
 

635
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,470
and you're going to plot it
and let it run on your farm and then

636
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
and let it run on your farm and then
 

637
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,230
and let it run on your farm and then
upgrade it or add another one and

638
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
upgrade it or add another one and
 

639
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,150
upgrade it or add another one and
you can continually kind of grow it that

640
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
you can continually kind of grow it that
 

641
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,430
you can continually kind of grow it that
way but don't go

642
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
way but don't go
 

643
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,030
way but don't go
sinking a bunch of money into something

644
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
sinking a bunch of money into something
 

645
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,870
sinking a bunch of money into something
that hasn't generated anything for you

646
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
that hasn't generated anything for you
 

647
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,670
that hasn't generated anything for you
yet

648
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
yet
 

649
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,310
yet
okay build yourself and there's there's

650
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
okay build yourself and there's there's
 

651
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,750
okay build yourself and there's there's
a flip side to that because

652
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
a flip side to that because
 

653
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,430
a flip side to that because
early adopters you know the early bird

654
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
early adopters you know the early bird
 

655
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,110
early adopters you know the early bird
gets the worm and that's absolutely true

656
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
gets the worm and that's absolutely true
 

657
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,470
gets the worm and that's absolutely true
with something like chia because

658
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
with something like chia because
 

659
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,710
with something like chia because
the more people who start farming it the

660
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
the more people who start farming it the
 

661
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,470
the more people who start farming it the
harder it will be to get chia

662
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
harder it will be to get chia
 

663
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,230
harder it will be to get chia
and so you know the early adopters are

664
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
and so you know the early adopters are
 

665
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,509
and so you know the early adopters are
the ones who are going to get

666
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
the ones who are going to get
 

667
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,550
the ones who are going to get
the chia coin really really quickly so

668
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
the chia coin really really quickly so
 

669
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,990
the chia coin really really quickly so
there's a flip side to it too

670
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
there's a flip side to it too
 

671
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,670
there's a flip side to it too
if you can pull up some extra storage

672
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
if you can pull up some extra storage
 

673
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,150
if you can pull up some extra storage
and you know hook it up then that's

674
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
and you know hook it up then that's
 

675
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,990
and you know hook it up then that's
great but

676
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
great but
 

677
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,590
great but
but there's a fine line between

678
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
but there's a fine line between
 

679
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,389
but there's a fine line between
setting up a farm and gambling and i

680
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
setting up a farm and gambling and i
 

681
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,030
setting up a farm and gambling and i
would say

682
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
would say
 

683
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,710
would say
as soon as you cross over that line or

684
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
as soon as you cross over that line or
 

685
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,230
as soon as you cross over that line or
even approach that line

686
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
even approach that line
 

687
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,190
even approach that line
uh back up okay that just use what you

688
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
uh back up okay that just use what you
 

689
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,829
uh back up okay that just use what you
have

690
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
have
 

691
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,550
have
and and that's the sweet spot to get

692
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
and and that's the sweet spot to get
 

693
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,350
and and that's the sweet spot to get
started

694
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
started
 

695
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,350
started
and if you have to put a little bit of

696
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
and if you have to put a little bit of
 

697
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,870
and if you have to put a little bit of
hardware into it then

698
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
hardware into it then
 

699
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,389
hardware into it then
by all means do but just keep it within

700
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
by all means do but just keep it within
 

701
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,750
by all means do but just keep it within
reason and watch out

702
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
reason and watch out
 

703
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,030
reason and watch out
you know don't look at that calculator

704
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
you know don't look at that calculator
 

705
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,870
you know don't look at that calculator
and say wow i'm going to get 600 a month

706
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
and say wow i'm going to get 600 a month
 

707
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,470
and say wow i'm going to get 600 a month
on my raspberry pi

708
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
on my raspberry pi
 

709
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,829
on my raspberry pi
well then you've got to factor in that

710
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
well then you've got to factor in that
 

711
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,910
well then you've got to factor in that
you're going to actually need to buy

712
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
you're going to actually need to buy
 

713
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,509
you're going to actually need to buy
four nvme drives because you're going to

714
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
four nvme drives because you're going to
 

715
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,630
four nvme drives because you're going to
burn through them in order to create

716
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
burn through them in order to create
 

717
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,910
burn through them in order to create
that many plots

718
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
that many plots
 

719
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,910
that many plots
so you you know you've got to be careful

720
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
so you you know you've got to be careful
 

721
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,190
so you you know you've got to be careful
of that so

722
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
of that so
 

723
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,870
of that so
start small work your way there and

724
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
start small work your way there and
 

725
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,030
start small work your way there and
then you can start to increase that as

726
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
then you can start to increase that as
 

727
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,990
then you can start to increase that as
you grow

728
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
you grow
 

729
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,470
you grow
okay makes sense um now if i decided

730
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
okay makes sense um now if i decided
 

731
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,870
okay makes sense um now if i decided
you know i've been mining chia for three

732
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
you know i've been mining chia for three
 

733
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,310
you know i've been mining chia for three
years farming

734
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
years farming
 

735
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,829
years farming
farming sorry i've got to get used to

736
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
farming sorry i've got to get used to
 

737
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,069
farming sorry i've got to get used to
this farming yes say i've been farming

738
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
this farming yes say i've been farming
 

739
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:08,629
this farming yes say i've been farming
chia

740
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
chia
 

741
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,670
chia
for a couple of years now and and i've

742
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
for a couple of years now and and i've
 

743
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,350
for a couple of years now and and i've
but it's only been out for a week well

744
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
but it's only been out for a week well
 

745
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,350
but it's only been out for a week well
yeah but i decide that yeah

746
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
yeah but i decide that yeah
 

747
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,389
yeah but i decide that yeah
i'm done and i want to and i finished

748
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
i'm done and i want to and i finished
 

749
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,470
i'm done and i want to and i finished
i'm finished maybe it's gotten so

750
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
i'm finished maybe it's gotten so
 

751
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,870
i'm finished maybe it's gotten so
complex that you can no longer get chia

752
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
complex that you can no longer get chia
 

753
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,710
complex that you can no longer get chia
right so can i um

754
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
right so can i um
 

755
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,470
right so can i um
repurpose those hard drives for

756
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
repurpose those hard drives for
 

757
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,829
repurpose those hard drives for
something else can i use them for a

758
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
something else can i use them for a
 

759
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,190
something else can i use them for a
different cryptocurrency or

760
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
different cryptocurrency or
 

761
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,470
different cryptocurrency or
is the whole thing like once it's

762
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
is the whole thing like once it's
 

763
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,750
is the whole thing like once it's
plotted that's it you're done the only

764
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
plotted that's it you're done the only
 

765
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,590
plotted that's it you're done the only
thing you're burning through is the nvme

766
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
thing you're burning through is the nvme
 

767
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,509
thing you're burning through is the nvme
so you probably won't want to reuse that

768
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
so you probably won't want to reuse that
 

769
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,030
so you probably won't want to reuse that
nvme drive you'll want to use that for

770
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
nvme drive you'll want to use that for
 

771
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,629
nvme drive you'll want to use that for
plotting until it dies

772
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
plotting until it dies
 

773
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,990
plotting until it dies
as far as your farming hardware goes

774
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
as far as your farming hardware goes
 

775
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
as far as your farming hardware goes
yeah absolutely repurpose that hard

776
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
yeah absolutely repurpose that hard
 

777
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,269
yeah absolutely repurpose that hard
drive

778
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
drive
 

779
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,949
drive
use it as an external backup drive for

780
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
use it as an external backup drive for
 

781
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,790
use it as an external backup drive for
your computer whatever you want to do

782
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
your computer whatever you want to do
 

783
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,350
your computer whatever you want to do
use it as extra storage put it in a raid

784
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
use it as extra storage put it in a raid
 

785
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,990
use it as extra storage put it in a raid
array

786
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
array
 

787
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,829
array
yeah absolutely we reuse it it's just a

788
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
yeah absolutely we reuse it it's just a
 

789
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,269
yeah absolutely we reuse it it's just a
hard drive okay

790
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
hard drive okay
 

791
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,710
hard drive okay
well those are all kind of the top

792
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
well those are all kind of the top
 

793
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,990
well those are all kind of the top
questions and i think it kind of covers

794
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
questions and i think it kind of covers
 

795
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,190
questions and i think it kind of covers
the gamut from

796
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
the gamut from
 

797
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,829
the gamut from
getting started to well shutting her

798
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
getting started to well shutting her
 

799
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,230
getting started to well shutting her
down

800
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
down
 

801
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,269
down
here we are yeah we're going to be

802
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
here we are yeah we're going to be
 

803
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,590
here we are yeah we're going to be
looking at chia over the course of the

804
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
looking at chia over the course of the
 

805
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,350
looking at chia over the course of the
next little while as it grows

806
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
next little while as it grows
 

807
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,870
next little while as it grows
and uh we are going to be doing some
