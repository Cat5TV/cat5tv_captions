essentially

54
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
essentially
 

55
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,270
essentially
a tool for funneling

56
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
a tool for funneling
 

57
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,630
a tool for funneling
spawned mobs into a focal point so that

58
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
spawned mobs into a focal point so that
 

59
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,389
spawned mobs into a focal point so that
you can easily kill them

60
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
you can easily kill them
 

61
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,390
you can easily kill them
and collect the experience and the loot

62
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
and collect the experience and the loot
 

63
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,429
and collect the experience and the loot
that drops from them

64
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
that drops from them

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,270
that drops from them
so we're gonna go and i'm gonna show you

66
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
so we're gonna go and i'm gonna show you
 

67
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,469
so we're gonna go and i'm gonna show you
kind of what you need to do to get

68
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
kind of what you need to do to get
 

69
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,350
kind of what you need to do to get
started

70
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
started
 

71
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,190
started
and what you're gonna end up with as

72
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
and what you're gonna end up with as
 

73
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,390
and what you're gonna end up with as
your final product

74
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
your final product
 

75
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,830
your final product
as you see behind me this is a spawner

76
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
as you see behind me this is a spawner
 

77
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,350
as you see behind me this is a spawner
you can see that there's a little tiny

78
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
you can see that there's a little tiny
 

79
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,190
you can see that there's a little tiny
zombie spinning around inside it looks

80
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
zombie spinning around inside it looks
 

81
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,830
zombie spinning around inside it looks
like a

82
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
like a
 

83
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,550
like a
kind of a jail cage and if you're mining

84
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
kind of a jail cage and if you're mining
 

85
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,670
kind of a jail cage and if you're mining
you're going to come across one

86
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
you're going to come across one
 

87
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,350
you're going to come across one
eventually it's in a small room that's

88
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
eventually it's in a small room that's
 

89
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,350
eventually it's in a small room that's
about uh

90
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
about uh
 

91
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,310
about uh
maybe 10 blocks wide and this will

92
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
maybe 10 blocks wide and this will
 

93
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,870
maybe 10 blocks wide and this will
create

94
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
create
 

95
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,030
create
an infinite supply of of mobs that are

96
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
an infinite supply of of mobs that are
 

97
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,630
an infinite supply of of mobs that are
going to come at you as soon as you find

98
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
going to come at you as soon as you find
 

99
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,429
going to come at you as soon as you find
it you want to

100
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
it you want to
 

101
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,590
it you want to
a kill the mobs that are there but b you

102
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
a kill the mobs that are there but b you
 

103
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,270
a kill the mobs that are there but b you
also want to disable

104
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
also want to disable
 

105
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,190
also want to disable
the spawner and you do that by putting

106
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
the spawner and you do that by putting
 

107
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,069
the spawner and you do that by putting
torches on all of the sides and on top

108
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
torches on all of the sides and on top
 

109
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,789
torches on all of the sides and on top
and that's going to disable your spawner

110
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
and that's going to disable your spawner
 

111
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,270
and that's going to disable your spawner
at that point you can start working on

112
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
at that point you can start working on
 

113
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,069
at that point you can start working on
the giant box that's going to go around

114
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
the giant box that's going to go around
 

115
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,389
the giant box that's going to go around
it

116
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
it
 

117
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,469
it
that's going to funnel everything over

118
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
that's going to funnel everything over
 

119
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,990
that's going to funnel everything over
to a system like that

120
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
to a system like that
 

121
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,830
to a system like that
now before you get started you're going

122
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
now before you get started you're going
 

123
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,190
now before you get started you're going
to need to have an infill

124
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
to need to have an infill
 

125
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,030
to need to have an infill
infinite water source because you do

126
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
infinite water source because you do
 

127
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,870
infinite water source because you do
need water for this build

128
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
need water for this build
 

129
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,749
need water for this build
and so with that i want to show you how

130
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
and so with that i want to show you how
 

131
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,590
and so with that i want to show you how
infinite water works

132
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
infinite water works
 

133
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,790
infinite water works
so we're going to empty this out

134
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
so we're going to empty this out
 

135
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,110
so we're going to empty this out
and the water disappears if i add a

136
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
and the water disappears if i add a
 

137
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,710
and the water disappears if i add a
water bucket to one side

138
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
water bucket to one side
 

139
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,110
water bucket to one side
it flows over and you can see how the

140
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
it flows over and you can see how the
 

141
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,869
it flows over and you can see how the
water tapers off and you can see that

142
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
water tapers off and you can see that
 

143
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,229
water tapers off and you can see that
directional flow

144
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
directional flow
 

145
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,190
directional flow
from left to right if i then try and

146
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
from left to right if i then try and
 

147
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,869
from left to right if i then try and
collect the water in the center

148
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
collect the water in the center
 

149
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,869
collect the water in the center
nothing happens if i collect it over

150
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
nothing happens if i collect it over
 

151
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,550
nothing happens if i collect it over
here nothing happens i collect that

152
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
here nothing happens i collect that
 

153
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,070
here nothing happens i collect that
block it disappears

154
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
block it disappears
 

155
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,670
block it disappears
so to create an infinite water source

156
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
so to create an infinite water source
 

157
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,190
so to create an infinite water source
you need to create

158
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
you need to create
 

159
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,150
you need to create
three blocks wide of a hole and put

160
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
three blocks wide of a hole and put
 

161
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,869
three blocks wide of a hole and put
water on

162
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
water on
 

163
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,350
water on
either side and then that center block

164
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
either side and then that center block
 

165
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,229
either side and then that center block
fills up

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
going to put one
 

331
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,749
going to put one
here now as you can see the water

332
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
here now as you can see the water
 

333
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,550
here now as you can see the water
doesn't go

334
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
doesn't go
 

335
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,749
doesn't go
all the way across the floor and so when

336
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
all the way across the floor and so when
 

337
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,189
all the way across the floor and so when
the zombies spawn in here the water is

338
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
the zombies spawn in here the water is
 

339
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,629
the zombies spawn in here the water is
going to push them

340
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
going to push them
 

341
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,310
going to push them
but it's only going to push them so far

342
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
but it's only going to push them so far
 

343
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,070
but it's only going to push them so far
so we need to make

344
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
so we need to make
 

345
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,310
so we need to make
an adjustment to this room that's going

346
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
an adjustment to this room that's going
 

347
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,990
an adjustment to this room that's going
to allow them to go even further and so

348
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
to allow them to go even further and so
 

349
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,430
to allow them to go even further and so
for that i'm going to take you to the

350
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
for that i'm going to take you to the
 

351
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,270
for that i'm going to take you to the
other room that i've made so you can see

352
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
other room that i've made so you can see
 

353
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,749
other room that i've made so you can see
everything

354
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
everything
 

355
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,790
everything
in completion

356
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
in completion
 

357
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,430
in completion
so what i've done is where the water

358
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
so what i've done is where the water
 

359
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,670
so what i've done is where the water
runs to you can see the edging of it

360
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
runs to you can see the edging of it
 

361
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,870
runs to you can see the edging of it
i've removed one block in so that the

362
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
i've removed one block in so that the
 

363
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,070
i've removed one block in so that the
water then flows

364
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
water then flows
 

365
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,150
water then flows
over the edge of those blocks and pushes

366
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
over the edge of those blocks and pushes
 

367
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,430
over the edge of those blocks and pushes
to the center

368
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
to the center
 

369
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,909
to the center
and with those two water sources in

370
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
and with those two water sources in
 

371
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,189
and with those two water sources in
either corner

372
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
either corner
 

373
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,990
either corner
all of the water funnels to this section

the mobs spawn in the room

378
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
the mobs spawn in the room
 

379
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,110
the mobs spawn in the room
once you have done that you need to

380
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
once you have done that you need to
 

381
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,590
once you have done that you need to
clear

382
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
clear
 

383
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,909
clear
all the torches from the room and place

384
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
all the torches from the room and place
 

385
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,710
all the torches from the room and place
a slab

386
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
a slab
 

387
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,830
a slab
on top of the spawner the reason why you

388
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
on top of the spawner the reason why you
 

389
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,270
on top of the spawner the reason why you
want to use a slab

390
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
want to use a slab
 

391
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,909
want to use a slab
is because the zombies will not spawn on

392
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
is because the zombies will not spawn on
 

393
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,950
is because the zombies will not spawn on
a half block

394
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
a half block
 

395
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,510
a half block
they will only spawn on whole blocks and

396
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
they will only spawn on whole blocks and
 

397
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,309
they will only spawn on whole blocks and
with that

398
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
with that
 

399
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,390
with that
slot being there no no zombie is going

400
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
slot being there no no zombie is going
 

401
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,590
slot being there no no zombie is going
to spawn on top of it

402
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
to spawn on top of it
 

403
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,110
to spawn on top of it
and then potentially stay there and not

404
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
and then potentially stay there and not
 

405
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,710
and then potentially stay there and not
want to fall off because you want them

406
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
want to fall off because you want them
 

407
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,029
want to fall off because you want them
to

408
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
to
 

409
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,870
to
spawn in the water and be funneled to

410
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
spawn in the water and be funneled to
 

411
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,189
spawn in the water and be funneled to

00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
of this tutorial i'm not going to remove
 

415
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,790
of this tutorial i'm not going to remove
the

416
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
the
 

417
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,670
the
torches but i will show you the rest of

418
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
torches but i will show you the rest of
 

419
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,309
torches but i will show you the rest of
the build

420
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
the build
 

421
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,430
the build
and how it works so the water then flows

422
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
and how it works so the water then flows
 

423
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,469
and how it works so the water then flows
into this little funnel point

424
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
into this little funnel point
 

425
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,950
into this little funnel point
now i've used it out of glass so that

426
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
now i've used it out of glass so that
 

427
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,309
now i've used it out of glass so that
you can see how it works

428
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
you can see how it works
 

429
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,629
you can see how it works
but you can use stone whatever you want

430
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
but you can use stone whatever you want
 

431
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,710
but you can use stone whatever you want
and when you get inside the tube

432
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
and when you get inside the tube
 

433
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,589
and when you get inside the tube
there's two signs the reason for those

434
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
there's two signs the reason for those
 

435
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,550
there's two signs the reason for those
signs is to stop the water in this

436
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
signs is to stop the water in this
 

437
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,189
signs is to stop the water in this
upwards elevator shaft so to speak from

438
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
upwards elevator shaft so to speak from
 

439
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,749
upwards elevator shaft so to speak from
flowing

440
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
flowing
 

441
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,189
flowing
back into that giant room

442
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
back into that giant room
 

443
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,110
back into that giant room
so the water will push the zombies into

444
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
so the water will push the zombies into
 

445
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,350
so the water will push the zombies into
here and as they pile up in this tube

446
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
here and as they pile up in this tube
 

447
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,270
here and as they pile up in this tube
they'll start pushing one another

448
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
they'll start pushing one another
 

449
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,070
they'll start pushing one another
into this water elevator now with the

450
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
into this water elevator now with the
 

451
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,309
into this water elevator now with the
mechanics of minecraft

452
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
mechanics of minecraft
 

453
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,790
mechanics of minecraft
you have to have soul sand underneath

454
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
you have to have soul sand underneath
 

455
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,830
you have to have soul sand underneath
water

456
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
water
 

457
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,589
water
to push them up it creates bubbles

458
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
to push them up it creates bubbles
 

459
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,189
to push them up it creates bubbles
that's going to push the zombies up and

460
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
that's going to push the zombies up and
 

461
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,510
that's going to push the zombies up and
in order to for this to work

462
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
in order to for this to work
 

463
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,230
in order to for this to work
you have to have a unique water block

464
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
you have to have a unique water block
 

465
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,469
you have to have a unique water block
every level of that channel

466
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
every level of that channel
 

467
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,629
every level of that channel
so there's a water block here a water

468
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
so there's a water block here a water
 

469
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,189
so there's a water block here a water
block here water block here and here

470
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
block here water block here and here
 

471
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,869
block here water block here and here
all the way up to the top and that's why

472
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
all the way up to the top and that's why
 

473
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,029
all the way up to the top and that's why
you want your infinite water source

474
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
you want your infinite water source
 

475
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,629
you want your infinite water source
because if i just put a water block at

476
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
because if i just put a water block at
 

477
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,550
because if i just put a water block at
the top the water is going to fall

478
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
the top the water is going to fall
 

479
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,469
the top the water is going to fall
all the way down and then you're not

480
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
all the way down and then you're not
 

481
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,830
all the way down and then you're not
going to get those bubbles it needs to

482
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
going to get those bubbles it needs to
 

483
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,710
going to get those bubbles it needs to
be unique bubbles every time

484
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
be unique bubbles every time
 

485
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,950
be unique bubbles every time
now with the mechanics of zombies they

486
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
now with the mechanics of zombies they
 

487
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,830
now with the mechanics of zombies they
are 20

488
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
are 20
 

489
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,390
are 20
health points plus two armor points even

490
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
health points plus two armor points even
 

491
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,390

if they don't have armor themselves

492
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
if they don't have armor themselves

hopper is now collecting all the

690
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
hopper is now collecting all the
 

691
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,150
hopper is now collecting all the
resources

692
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
resources
 

693
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,150
resources
and putting them in the chest but in the

694
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
and putting them in the chest but in the
 

695
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,069
and putting them in the chest but in the
case of here we don't have anything in

696
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
case of here we don't have anything in
 

697
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,430
case of here we don't have anything in
this chest and that's because we've

698
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
this chest and that's because we've
 

699
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,389
this chest and that's because we've
actually made

700
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
actually made
 

701
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,910
actually made
a hopper system with many many chests

702
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
a hopper system with many many chests
 

703
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,590
a hopper system with many many chests
so there's the chest that they fall into

704
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
so there's the chest that they fall into
 

705
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,110
so there's the chest that they fall into
the hoppers continue to process

706
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
the hoppers continue to process
 

707
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,389
the hoppers continue to process
everything down

708
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
everything down
 

709
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,829
everything down
until you get to that bottom chest and

710
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
until you get to that bottom chest and
 

711
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,190
until you get to that bottom chest and
there's the flesh from the zombies that

712
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
there's the flesh from the zombies that

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
and that's how you make a zombie or
 

717
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,069
