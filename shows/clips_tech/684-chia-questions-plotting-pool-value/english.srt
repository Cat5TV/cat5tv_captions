00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,590
it seems like chia is all anybody's
talking about and we're not talking

00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
on we're talking about the
 

11
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,190
on we're talking about the
cryptocurrency oh

12
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
cryptocurrency oh
 

13
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,110
cryptocurrency oh
it's an exciting new cryptocurrency and

14
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
it's an exciting new cryptocurrency and
 

15
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,950
it's an exciting new cryptocurrency and
the reason it's exciting is because it's

16
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
the reason it's exciting is because it's
 

17
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,589
the reason it's exciting is because it's
changing the face of cryptocurrency

18
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
changing the face of cryptocurrency
 

19
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,230

farming

20
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
farming
 

21
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,070
farming
by going with a completely different

22
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
by going with a completely different
 

23
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,510
by going with a completely different
method through

24
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
method through
 

25
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,230
method through
uh proof of or proof of space is that

26
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
uh proof of or proof of space is that
 

27
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,590
uh proof of or proof of space is that
what you call it proof of space

28
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
what you call it proof of space
 

29
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,589
what you call it proof of space
end time yes

30
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599

 

31
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,269

now we've had a couple of episodes where

32
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
now we've had a couple of episodes where
 

33
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,109
now we've had a couple of episodes where
we're talking about uh some of the

34
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
we're talking about uh some of the
 

35
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,870
we're talking about uh some of the
questions that have come in about chia

36
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
questions that have come in about chia
 

37
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,870
questions that have come in about chia
and even more are rolling in as people

38
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
and even more are rolling in as people
 

39
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,470
and even more are rolling in as people
are starting to catch on

40
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
are starting to catch on
 

41
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,150
are starting to catch on
they're getting involved and so the

42
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
they're getting involved and so the
 

43
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,270
they're getting involved and so the
questions are getting a little bit

44
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
questions are getting a little bit
 

45
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,910
questions are getting a little bit
deeper

46
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
deeper
 

47
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,630
deeper
jeff i'm getting involved yes you are

48
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
jeff i'm getting involved yes you are
 

49
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,350
jeff i'm getting involved yes you are
actually we

50
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
actually we
 

51
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,630
actually we
both are getting it's exciting times

52
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
both are getting it's exciting times
 

53
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,310
both are getting it's exciting times
so i'm going to hop right into it and

54
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
so i'm going to hop right into it and
 

55
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,750
so i'm going to hop right into it and
i'm going to see if i can stump robbie

56
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
i'm going to see if i can stump robbie
 

57
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,750
i'm going to see if i can stump robbie
oh you got some questions

58
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
oh you got some questions
 

59
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,430
oh you got some questions
i do if they're getting deeper they're

60
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
i do if they're getting deeper they're
 

61
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,510
i do if they're getting deeper they're
getting harder let's hope i did enough

62
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
getting harder let's hope i did enough
 

63
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,549
getting harder let's hope i did enough
research

64
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
research
 

65
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,150
research
i hope so what do you got for me all

66
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
i hope so what do you got for me all
 

67
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,069
i hope so what do you got for me all
right first question yeah

68
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
right first question yeah
 

69
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,549
right first question yeah
for my chia farm drive should i format

70
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
for my chia farm drive should i format
 

71
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,710
for my chia farm drive should i format
an ntfs

72
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
an ntfs
 

73
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,270
an ntfs
uh okay so this is the farm drive this

74
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
uh okay so this is the farm drive this
 

75
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,429
uh okay so this is the farm drive this
is nothing to do with the plotter

76
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
is nothing to do with the plotter
 

77
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,030
is nothing to do with the plotter
correct i am planning to put my chia

78
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
correct i am planning to put my chia
 

79
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,590
correct i am planning to put my chia
farm

80
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
farm
 

81
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,870
farm
on a raspberry pi 4.

82
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
on a raspberry pi 4.
 

83
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,870
on a raspberry pi 4.
um so it's going to be an external drive

84
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
um so it's going to be an external drive
 

85
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,550
um so it's going to be an external drive
on my raspberry pi connected

86
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
on my raspberry pi connected
 

87
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,590
on my raspberry pi connected
because it's such a light like

88
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
because it's such a light like
 

89
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,670
because it's such a light like
so low powered so low cost and so

90
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
so low powered so low cost and so
 

91
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,390
so low powered so low cost and so
ntfs is not the right solution but the

92
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
ntfs is not the right solution but the
 

93
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,550
ntfs is not the right solution but the
problem that we run into is that we want

94
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
problem that we run into is that we want
 

95
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,749
problem that we run into is that we want
our farming drive so where we put our

96
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
our farming drive so where we put our
 

97
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,590
our farming drive so where we put our
plots to be

98
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
plots to be
 

99
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,190
plots to be
accessible from any machine so that be

100
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
accessible from any machine so that be
 

101
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,789
accessible from any machine so that be
like i i'm assuming jeff that your um

102
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
like i i'm assuming jeff that your um
 

103
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,510
like i i'm assuming jeff that your um
your plotting system is a windows system

104
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
your plotting system is a windows system
 

105
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,389
your plotting system is a windows system
as an example

106
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
as an example
 

107
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,870
as an example
so because i'm going to be moving it

108
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
so because i'm going to be moving it
 

109
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,389
so because i'm going to be moving it
onto a raspberry pi which is

00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
onto a raspberry pi which is
 

111
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,870
onto a raspberry pi which is
linux i want a format that's going to be

112
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
linux i want a format that's going to be
 

113
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,830
linux i want a format that's going to be
compatible with that

114
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
compatible with that
 

115
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,709
compatible with that
of course yes i can use ntfs but then

116
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
of course yes i can use ntfs but then
 

117
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,830
of course yes i can use ntfs but then
you've got to install

chia coin will i have to replot
 

167
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,150
chia coin will i have to replot
my farm because i've already plotted it

168
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
my farm because i've already plotted it
 

169
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,589
my farm because i've already plotted it
for solo mining or

170
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
for solo mining or
 

171
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,869
for solo mining or
solo farming correct yes and no um so

172
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
solo farming correct yes and no um so
 

173
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,430
solo farming correct yes and no um so
yes in that if you want to use that same

174
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
yes in that if you want to use that same
 

175
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,470
yes in that if you want to use that same
space

176
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
space
 

177
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,309
space
for pools yes you will have to refarm it

178
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
for pools yes you will have to refarm it
 

179
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,149
for pools yes you will have to refarm it
uh re re-plot it but the fact is is that

180
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
uh re re-plot it but the fact is is that
 

181
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,430
uh re re-plot it but the fact is is that
plotting takes a long time jeff and so

182
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
plotting takes a long time jeff and so
 

183
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,550
plotting takes a long time jeff and so
what i would actually do is i would

184
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
what i would actually do is i would
 

185
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,390
what i would actually do is i would
take a different approach and instead of

186
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
take a different approach and instead of
 

187
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,589
take a different approach and instead of
re-plotting

188
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
re-plotting
 

189
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,550
re-plotting
just simply continue plotting but as we

190
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
just simply continue plotting but as we
 

191
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,830
just simply continue plotting but as we
continue plotting

192
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
continue plotting
 

193
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,110
continue plotting
we're going to continue plotting um

194
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
we're going to continue plotting um
 

195
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,830
we're going to continue plotting um
for the pools right does that make sense

196
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
for the pools right does that make sense
 

197
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,149
for the pools right does that make sense
so

198
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
so
 

199
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,990
so
totally makes sense so right now we're

200
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
totally makes sense so right now we're
 

201
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,550
totally makes sense so right now we're
plotting for solo farming but

202
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
plotting for solo farming but
 

203
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,190
plotting for solo farming but
we can't use those same uh those same

204
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
we can't use those same uh those same
 

205
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,149
we can't use those same uh those same
plots for

206
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
plots for
 

207
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,149
plots for
pools um when pools are available to us

208
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
pools um when pools are available to us
 

209
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,190
pools um when pools are available to us
we want to be able to create new plots

210
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
we want to be able to create new plots
 

211
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,509
we want to be able to create new plots
and those plots will be accessible by

212
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
and those plots will be accessible by
 

213
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,710
and those plots will be accessible by
our

214
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
our
 

215
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,910
our
by our pools makes sense now so like add

216
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
by our pools makes sense now so like add
 

217
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,030
by our pools makes sense now so like add
to it yeah now speaking of pools they're

218
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
to it yeah now speaking of pools they're
 

219
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,149
to it yeah now speaking of pools they're
not yet available

220
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
not yet available
 

221
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,470
not yet available
no do we know not technically i mean

222
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
no do we know not technically i mean
 

223
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,990
no do we know not technically i mean
people are they're they're our friends

224
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
people are they're they're our friends
 

225
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,470
people are they're they're our friends
like

226
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
like
 

227
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,789
like
jeff if you and i wanted to go together

228
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
jeff if you and i wanted to go together
 

229
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,670
jeff if you and i wanted to go together
and say

230
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
and say
 

231
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,070
and say
hey let's create like a clustered

232
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
hey let's create like a clustered
 

233
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,030
hey let's create like a clustered
environment where

234
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
environment where
 

235
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,910
environment where
you and i are creating a bit of a pool

236
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
you and i are creating a bit of a pool
 

237
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,949
you and i are creating a bit of a pool
but as far as official pools go um

238
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
but as far as official pools go um
 

239
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,270
but as far as official pools go um
the question is when i don't have an

240
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
the question is when i don't have an
 

241
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,789
the question is when i don't have an
answer to exactly when i don't think

242
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
answer to exactly when i don't think
 

243
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,349
answer to exactly when i don't think
anyone

244
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
anyone
 

245
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,189
anyone
really does however it should be noted

246
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
really does however it should be noted
 

247
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,390
really does however it should be noted
that just

248
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
that just
 

249
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,110
that just
um a few days ago as we're recording

250
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
um a few days ago as we're recording
 

251
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,710
um a few days ago as we're recording
this video but um

252
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
this video but um
 

253
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,830
this video but um
i think may 18th we started to see some

254
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
i think may 18th we started to see some
 

255
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,469
i think may 18th we started to see some
action

256
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
action
 

257
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,830
action
on the official chia network

258
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
on the official chia network
 

259
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,670
on the official chia network
github and on that on that github page

260
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
github and on that on that github page
 

261
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,430
github and on that on that github page
we started to see some open source code

262
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
we started to see some open source code
 

263
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,950
we started to see some open source code
coming out for pool

264
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
coming out for pool
 

265
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,629
coming out for pool
um connectivity for the chia plotter so

266
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
um connectivity for the chia plotter so
 

267
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,550
um connectivity for the chia plotter so
this is going to be really exciting do

268
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
this is going to be really exciting do
 

269
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,830
this is going to be really exciting do
we know when it's going to

270
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
we know when it's going to
 

271
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,870
we know when it's going to
actually take place no but it's very

272
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
actually take place no but it's very
 

273
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,670
actually take place no but it's very
very soon

274
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
very soon
 

275
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,550
very soon
i mean may 18th we started to see the

276
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
i mean may 18th we started to see the
 

277
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,310
i mean may 18th we started to see the
code going up and

278
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
code going up and
 

279
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,150
code going up and
we're going to start seeing that take

280
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
we're going to start seeing that take
 

281
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,749
we're going to start seeing that take
effect that's exciting

282
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
effect that's exciting
 

283
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,749
effect that's exciting
very cool all right should i say what

284
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
very cool all right should i say what
 

285
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,110
very cool all right should i say what
pools are

286
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
pools are
 

287
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,830
pools are
sure so as we're solo farming that means

288
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
sure so as we're solo farming that means
 

289
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,150
sure so as we're solo farming that means
that

290
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
that
 

291
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,390
that
it's your hardware trying to get chia

292
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
it's your hardware trying to get chia
 

293
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,150
it's your hardware trying to get chia
coin as we pool

294
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
coin as we pool
 

295
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,430
coin as we pool
it would be jeff and me working together

296
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
it would be jeff and me working together
 

297
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,350
it would be jeff and me working together
with the power of all of our computers

298
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
with the power of all of our computers
 

299
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,590
with the power of all of our computers
in order to get well all of our storage

300
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
in order to get well all of our storage
 

301
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,990
in order to get well all of our storage
i guess

302
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
i guess
 

303
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,710
i guess
in in this proof of work uh proof of

304
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
in in this proof of work uh proof of
 

305
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,510
in in this proof of work uh proof of
space

306
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
space
 

307
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,029
space
and time not proof of work and

308
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
and time not proof of work and
 

309
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,950
and time not proof of work and
so we can kind of pool everything

310
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
so we can kind of pool everything
 

311
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,270
so we can kind of pool everything
together it's exactly as a sound

312
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
together it's exactly as a sound
 

313
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,830
together it's exactly as a sound
and with that pool we'll be much more

314
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
and with that pool we'll be much more
 

315
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,629
and with that pool we'll be much more
likely to get

316
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
likely to get
 

317
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,150
likely to get
chia so as a public pool becomes

318
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
chia so as a public pool becomes
 

319
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,909
chia so as a public pool becomes
available that means that there may be

320
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
available that means that there may be
 

321
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,909
available that means that there may be
hundreds or even thousands

322
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
hundreds or even thousands
 

323
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,150
hundreds or even thousands
of chia farmers who are going to be

324
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
of chia farmers who are going to be
 

325
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,110
of chia farmers who are going to be
using

326
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
using
 

327
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,150
using
the same pool and so me the little guy

328
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
the same pool and so me the little guy
 

329
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,870
the same pool and so me the little guy
who just has

330
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
who just has
 

331
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,390
who just has
four terabytes of chia plots

332
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
four terabytes of chia plots
 

333
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,070
four terabytes of chia plots
i have much more chance of actually

334
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
i have much more chance of actually
 

335
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,629
i have much more chance of actually
seeing some chia in my lifetime

336
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
seeing some chia in my lifetime
 

337
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,749
seeing some chia in my lifetime
right it's true okay now speaking of

338
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
right it's true okay now speaking of
 

339
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,270
right it's true okay now speaking of
plotting yeah uh if you've

340
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
plotting yeah uh if you've
 

341
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,950
plotting yeah uh if you've
stopped plotting say mid plot

342
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
stopped plotting say mid plot
 

343
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,550
stopped plotting say mid plot
uh mid plot yeah mid plot no don't do

344
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
uh mid plot yeah mid plot no don't do
 

345
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,909
uh mid plot yeah mid plot no don't do
this could be that you accidentally

346
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
this could be that you accidentally
 

347
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,430
this could be that you accidentally
stopped it maybe potentially stopped it

348
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
stopped it maybe potentially stopped it
 

349
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,469
stopped it maybe potentially stopped it
or maybe there's a power

350
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
or maybe there's a power
 

351
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,870
or maybe there's a power
tripped over the power cord exactly so

352
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
tripped over the power cord exactly so
 

353
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,550
tripped over the power cord exactly so
can you just pick up from where it's

354
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
can you just pick up from where it's
 

355
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,990
can you just pick up from where it's
going will things be frozen uh yeah the

356
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
going will things be frozen uh yeah the
 

357
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,189
going will things be frozen uh yeah the
plot will be lost

358
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
plot will be lost
 

359
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,110
plot will be lost
so anything that you're plotting will be

360
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
so anything that you're plotting will be
 

361
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,309
so anything that you're plotting will be
lost

362
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
lost
 

363
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,270
lost
but your previously finished plots will

364
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
but your previously finished plots will
 

365
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,550
but your previously finished plots will
be okay

366
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
be okay
 

367
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,590
be okay
but the stuff that is lost

368
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
but the stuff that is lost
 

369
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,590
but the stuff that is lost
there's a little trick right now and

370
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
there's a little trick right now and
 

371
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,110
there's a little trick right now and
this may be

372
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
this may be
 

373
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,230
this may be
improved in time i mean we're still very

374
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
improved in time i mean we're still very
 

375
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,950
improved in time i mean we're still very
very young

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,510
resume and start over uh i should say
if if that happens okay all right

factory farms and i like the sound of

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
factory farms and i like the sound of
 

457
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,550

that now assuming i can afford the

that now assuming i can afford the
 

459
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,070
that now assuming i can afford the

463
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,309
100 terabyte farm 100 terabytes
that's going to be expensive by the way

464
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
that's going to be expensive by the way
 

465
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,469
that's going to be expensive by the way
for the components so keep that in mind

466
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
for the components so keep that in mind
 

467
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,230
for the components so keep that in mind
but how can i get it fully up and

468
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
but how can i get it fully up and
 

469
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,909
but how can i get it fully up and
running as quick as possible

oh my gosh are you kidding me so

okay you have to actually plot those

478
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
okay you have to actually plot those
 

479
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,550
okay you have to actually plot those
plots first

480
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
plots first
 

481
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,550

so how would you do that you would have

482
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
so how would you do that you would have
 

483
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,909
so how would you do that you would have
to have

484
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
to have
 

485
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,430
to have
multiple nvmes set up in a raid array

486
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
multiple nvmes set up in a raid array
 

487
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,990
multiple nvmes set up in a raid array
set up in some kind of or not even a

489
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,029
set up in some kind of or not even a

490
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
raid array i mean
 

491
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,150
raid array i mean
let's be honest you could have just

492
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
let's be honest you could have just
 

493
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,670
let's be honest you could have just
separate plotters you could have

494
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
separate plotters you could have
 

495
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,670
separate plotters you could have
separate nvme drives

496
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
separate nvme drives
 

497
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,110
separate nvme drives
and you could be plotting on each of

498
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
and you could be plotting on each of
 

499
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,870
and you could be plotting on each of
those at the same time and then

500
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
those at the same time and then
 

501
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,230
those at the same time and then
piping that data out to the farm but a

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,590
that's a lot that is a lot i mean i'm
getting

508
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
getting
 

509
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,829
getting
so on my i990 9900k

510
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
so on my i990 9900k
 

511
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,350
so on my i990 9900k
with an mdot no i've got a

512
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
with an mdot no i've got a
 

513
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,310
with an mdot no i've got a
i'm using an ssd right now just an sata

514
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
i'm using an ssd right now just an sata
 

515
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,630
i'm using an ssd right now just an sata
ssd and i'm getting about two plus a day

516
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640

517
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,949
ssd and i'm getting about two plus a day
so like you've got to imagine you would

518
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
so like you've got to imagine you would
 

519
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,190
so like you've got to imagine you would
have to have an

520
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,200
have to have an
 

521
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,350
have to have an
astronomical amount of speed

522
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
astronomical amount of speed
 

523
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,070
astronomical amount of speed
as far as your nvmes go as far as your

524
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
as far as your nvmes go as far as your
 

525
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,590
as far as your nvmes go as far as your
data goes your i o

526
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
data goes your i o
 

527
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,470
data goes your i o
right um it would just be ridiculous but

528
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
right um it would just be ridiculous but
 

529
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,990
right um it would just be ridiculous but
you see folks doing this and

530
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
you see folks doing this and
 

531
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,550
you see folks doing this and
you say it's like a factory um and i

532
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
you say it's like a factory um and i
 

533
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,070
you say it's like a factory um and i
call it a factory farm

534
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
call it a factory farm
 

535
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,310
call it a factory farm
but that's exactly what it is you have

536
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
but that's exactly what it is you have
 

537
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,269
but that's exactly what it is you have
to have

538
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
to have
 

539
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,310
to have
the amount of capacity and in order the

540
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
the amount of capacity and in order the
 

541
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,470
the amount of capacity and in order the
the power to to actually create those

542
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
the power to to actually create those
 

543
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,670
the power to to actually create those
plots

544
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
plots
 

545
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,269
plots
you know jeff like you've been plotting

546
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
you know jeff like you've been plotting
 

547
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,590
you know jeff like you've been plotting
for the past couple of days yeah

548
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
for the past couple of days yeah
 

549
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,430
for the past couple of days yeah
it's it has been a lot slower than i

550
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
it's it has been a lot slower than i
 

551
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,190
it's it has been a lot slower than i
anticipated but part of that is because

552
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
anticipated but part of that is because
 

553
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,550
anticipated but part of that is because
i'm running an nvme

554
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
i'm running an nvme
 

555
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,670
i'm running an nvme
but it's over usb 3.0 or 3.1

556
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
but it's over usb 3.0 or 3.1
 

557
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,110
but it's over usb 3.0 or 3.1
3.0 3.0 yes you're not even on uh usbc

558
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
3.0 3.0 yes you're not even on uh usbc
 

559
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,750
3.0 3.0 yes you're not even on uh usbc
that's correct the old usb-a yeah i only

560
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
that's correct the old usb-a yeah i only
 

561
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,150
that's correct the old usb-a yeah i only
had one nvme slot on my uh

562
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
had one nvme slot on my uh
 

563
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,470
had one nvme slot on my uh
my computer and that's where

564
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
my computer and that's where
 

565
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,590
my computer and that's where
everything's located

566
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
everything's located
 

567
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,990
everything's located
so i'm doing everything over the the usb

568
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
so i'm doing everything over the the usb
 

569
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,829
so i'm doing everything over the the usb
so yeah it is slower

570
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
so yeah it is slower
 

571
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,190
so yeah it is slower
now getting into the post plotting

572
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
now getting into the post plotting
 

573
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,269
now getting into the post plotting
post farming you've earned some chia

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,910
wendy's and we have two questions about
that

that

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
that
and uh the first one chia isn't readily

you can get it on some exchanges but
 

591
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,509
you can get it on some exchanges but
they're very

592
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
they're very
 

593
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,069
they're very
down the wrong in what i would call

594
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
down the wrong in what i would call
 

595
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,990
down the wrong in what i would call
trustability but that's my opinion

596
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
trustability but that's my opinion
 

597
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,310
trustability but that's my opinion
um so so this person's asking what do i

598
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
um so so this person's asking what do i
 

599
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,350
um so so this person's asking what do i
do with my chia

600
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
do with my chia
 

601
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,389
do with my chia
hold yeah okay so is the price

602
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
hold yeah okay so is the price
 

603
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,230
hold yeah okay so is the price
and how is the price fluctuating if i

604
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
and how is the price fluctuating if i
 

605
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,910
and how is the price fluctuating if i
can't do anything with it

606
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
can't do anything with it
 

607
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,350
can't do anything with it
and and what do i do if i want to trade

608
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
and and what do i do if i want to trade
 

609
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,710
and and what do i do if i want to trade
it

610
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
it
 

611
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,949
it
we can't yet that's coming presumably

612
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
we can't yet that's coming presumably
 

613
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,750
we can't yet that's coming presumably
um but this is all you know we're we're

614
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
um but this is all you know we're we're
 

615
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,509
um but this is all you know we're we're
early adopters we are

616
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
early adopters we are
 

617
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,509
early adopters we are
the early bird right now okay so

618
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
the early bird right now okay so
 

619
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,030
the early bird right now okay so
understand that so

620
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
understand that so
 

621
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,069
understand that so
so a big part of the process of farming

622
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
so a big part of the process of farming
 

623
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,110
so a big part of the process of farming
chia right now

624
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
chia right now
 

625
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,230
chia right now
is to be that early bird you want to be

626
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
is to be that early bird you want to be
 

627
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,470
is to be that early bird you want to be
the ones who get this chia coin

628
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
the ones who get this chia coin
 

629
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,990
the ones who get this chia coin
while it's really easily available

630
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
while it's really easily available
 

631
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,470
while it's really easily available
for by farming rather than purchasing

632
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
for by farming rather than purchasing
 

633
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,230
for by farming rather than purchasing
because you've seen the price

634
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
because you've seen the price
 

635
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,310
because you've seen the price
go from six thousand dollars down to a

636
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
go from six thousand dollars down to a
 

637
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,910
go from six thousand dollars down to a
thousand and jeff was telling me what

638
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
thousand and jeff was telling me what
 

639
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,350
thousand and jeff was telling me what
about eight hundred today

640
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
about eight hundred today
 

641
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,590
about eight hundred today
uh yeah as we're recording this because

642
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
uh yeah as we're recording this because
 

643
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,550
uh yeah as we're recording this because
we're seeing

644
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
we're seeing
 

645
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,470
we're seeing
um we're seeing the cryptocurrency

646
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
um we're seeing the cryptocurrency
 

647
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,990
um we're seeing the cryptocurrency
market right now we're seeing a

648
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
market right now we're seeing a
 

649
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,750
market right now we're seeing a
consolidation so

650
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
consolidation so
 

651
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,750
consolidation so
things are kind of figuring themselves

652
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
things are kind of figuring themselves
 

653
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,110
things are kind of figuring themselves
out and and we're going to see those

654
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
out and and we're going to see those
 

655
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,750
out and and we're going to see those
prices

656
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
prices
 

657
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,430
prices
equalize and and we're going to see

658
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
equalize and and we're going to see
 

659
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,829
equalize and and we're going to see
where those land now as far as chia goes

660
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
where those land now as far as chia goes
 

661
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,910
where those land now as far as chia goes
because it's not currently on an

662
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
because it's not currently on an
 

663
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,990
because it's not currently on an
exchange that is readily available like

664
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
exchange that is readily available like
 

665
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,750
exchange that is readily available like
binance

666
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
binance
 

667
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,230
binance
we're not going to be able to trade that

668
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
we're not going to be able to trade that
 

669
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,030
we're not going to be able to trade that
right

670
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
right
 

671
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,110
right
so it's all about holding it's all about

672
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
so it's all about holding it's all about
 

673
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,030
so it's all about holding it's all about
accumulating and holding

674
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
accumulating and holding
 

675
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,069
accumulating and holding
at the moment and sure there are

676
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
at the moment and sure there are
 

677
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,870
at the moment and sure there are
exchanges that will allow you to trade

678
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
exchanges that will allow you to trade
 

679
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,190
exchanges that will allow you to trade
but i would as jeff says stay away from

680
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
but i would as jeff says stay away from
 

681
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,310
but i would as jeff says stay away from
those for the moment

682
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
those for the moment
 

683
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,710
those for the moment
that's just my personal opinion because

684
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
that's just my personal opinion because
 

685
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,910
that's just my personal opinion because
um i'm

686
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
um i'm
 

687
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,509
um i'm
i'm gonna hold my chia absolutely

688
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
i'm gonna hold my chia absolutely
 

689
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,350
i'm gonna hold my chia absolutely
okay so then is chia a hold coin or

690
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
okay so then is chia a hold coin or
 

691
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,069
okay so then is chia a hold coin or
is it setting up to be a trade coin coin

692
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
is it setting up to be a trade coin coin
 

693
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,030
is it setting up to be a trade coin coin
jeff isn't a

694
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
jeff isn't a
 

695
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,230
jeff isn't a
bottle coin well fair enough yeah but

696
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
bottle coin well fair enough yeah but
 

697
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,590
bottle coin well fair enough yeah but
there are some coins where it's like

698
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
there are some coins where it's like
 

699
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,949
there are some coins where it's like
this is the one i'm gonna trade with

700
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
this is the one i'm gonna trade with
 

701
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,550
this is the one i'm gonna trade with
it's focused on trading

702
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
it's focused on trading
 

703
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,230
it's focused on trading
okay or is this one of those ones

704
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
okay or is this one of those ones
 

705
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,550
okay or is this one of those ones
because it's a new model in the fact

706
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
because it's a new model in the fact
 

707
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,190
because it's a new model in the fact
that it's

708
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
that it's
 

709
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,030
that it's
i don't know that we really know yet i

710
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
i don't know that we really know yet i
 

711
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,470
i don't know that we really know yet i
mean

712
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
mean
 

713
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,470
mean
there are coins that are very volatile

714
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
there are coins that are very volatile
 

715
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,590
there are coins that are very volatile
and that their

716
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
and that their
 

717
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,710
and that their
their value fluctuates incredibly and

718
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
their value fluctuates incredibly and
 

719
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,629
their value fluctuates incredibly and
right now i know it's a very confusing

720
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
right now i know it's a very confusing
 

721
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,269
right now i know it's a very confusing
time

722
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
time
 

723
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,829
time
to get involved in cryptocurrency in

724
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
to get involved in cryptocurrency in
 

725
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,190
to get involved in cryptocurrency in
general because

726
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
general because
 

727
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,150
general because
it's so volatile the entire market but

728
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
it's so volatile the entire market but
 

729
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,509
it's so volatile the entire market but
we're going to see that pan out

730
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
we're going to see that pan out
 

731
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,590
we're going to see that pan out
as things start to equalize and figure

732
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
as things start to equalize and figure
 

733
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,030
as things start to equalize and figure
themselves out

734
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
themselves out
 

735
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,269
themselves out
but as far as chia goes we don't really

736
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
but as far as chia goes we don't really
 

737
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,870
but as far as chia goes we don't really
know where it's going to fall

738
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
know where it's going to fall
 

739
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,269
know where it's going to fall
and when it does fall we just want to be

740
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
and when it does fall we just want to be
 

741
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,870
and when it does fall we just want to be
in there we just want to be

742
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
in there we just want to be
 

743
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,910
in there we just want to be
a part of that cryptocurrency as far as

744
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
a part of that cryptocurrency as far as
 

745
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,310
a part of that cryptocurrency as far as
the

746
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
the
 

747
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,430
the
the market goes so if it's worth

748
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
the market goes so if it's worth
 

749
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,470
the market goes so if it's worth
400 when it finally drops on the

750
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
400 when it finally drops on the
 

751
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,790
400 when it finally drops on the
cryptocurrency exchanges great i want to

752
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
cryptocurrency exchanges great i want to
 

753
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,430
cryptocurrency exchanges great i want to
have a thousand of them

754
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
have a thousand of them
 

755
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,110
have a thousand of them
so do i yeah but if if it ends up being

756
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
so do i yeah but if if it ends up being
 

757
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,509
so do i yeah but if if it ends up being
worth

758
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
worth
 

759
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,269
worth
two or three thousand dollars like we

760
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
two or three thousand dollars like we
 

761
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,870
two or three thousand dollars like we
just don't know folks i mean

762
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
just don't know folks i mean
 

763
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,829
just don't know folks i mean
realistically

764
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
realistically
 

765
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,829
realistically
there's no way to really know at this

766
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
there's no way to really know at this
 

767
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,430
there's no way to really know at this
point what it's going to be valued at

768
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
point what it's going to be valued at
 

769
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,870
point what it's going to be valued at
when it hits the exchange

770
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
when it hits the exchange
 

771
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,790
when it hits the exchange
right when it does though you you know

772
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
right when it does though you you know
 

773
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,230
right when it does though you you know
you hope to have some

774
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
you hope to have some
 

775
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,990
you hope to have some
and and the fact is now jeff you were

776
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
and and the fact is now jeff you were
 

777
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,990
and and the fact is now jeff you were
asking a little bit about pooling

778
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
asking a little bit about pooling
 

779
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,509
asking a little bit about pooling
um and whether or not we're gonna have

780
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
um and whether or not we're gonna have
 

781
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,189
um and whether or not we're gonna have
to re-um

782
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
to re-um
 

783
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,750
to re-um
plot our pool uh our farm in order to

784
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
plot our pool uh our farm in order to
 

785
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,389
plot our pool uh our farm in order to
pool

786
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
pool
 

787
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,550
pool
um the fact is we can do both we can

788
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
um the fact is we can do both we can
 

789
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,590
um the fact is we can do both we can
both

790
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
both
 

791
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,269
both
farm pooled chia and we can farm

792
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
farm pooled chia and we can farm
 

793
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,310
farm pooled chia and we can farm
uh solo chia right so

794
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
uh solo chia right so
 

795
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,189
uh solo chia right so
knowing that well we we may as well kind

796
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
knowing that well we we may as well kind
 

797
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,150
knowing that well we we may as well kind
of get in on it

798

as soon as possible and then when it all
 

801
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,829
as soon as possible and then when it all
drops when everything comes together
