uh which is yes as you say it's like a

648
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
uh which is yes as you say it's like a
 

649
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,430
uh which is yes as you say it's like a
desktop widget system stats

650
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
desktop widget system stats
 

651
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,870
desktop widget system stats
so this gives us some insight into the

652
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
so this gives us some insight into the
 

653
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,310
so this gives us some insight into the
virtual appliance that we're running as

654
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
virtual appliance that we're running as
 

655
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,870
virtual appliance that we're running as
well so we see that it's a 64-bit

656
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
well so we see that it's a 64-bit
 

657
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,069
well so we see that it's a 64-bit
uh linux 5.9 kernel uh we're running

658
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
uh linux 5.9 kernel uh we're running
 

659
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,590
uh linux 5.9 kernel uh we're running
with a high load

660
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
with a high load
 

661
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,630
with a high load
two is our average load

662
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
two is our average load
 

663
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,670
two is our average load
uh 2.5 gigahertz

664
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
uh 2.5 gigahertz
 

665
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,790
uh 2.5 gigahertz
so we can see a little bit of

666
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
so we can see a little bit of
 

667
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,150
so we can see a little bit of
information about the virtual appliance

668
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
information about the virtual appliance
 

669
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,350
information about the virtual appliance
that we're running so what do we have

670
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
that we're running so what do we have
 

671
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,870
that we're running so what do we have
so we've got like this dock bar down

672
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
so we've got like this dock bar down
 

673
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,710
so we've got like this dock bar down
here i kind of dig that

674
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
here i kind of dig that

if we pull out this
 

737
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,430
if we pull out this
guy over here we can switch that over to

738
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
guy over here we can switch that over to

right probably not worth it um but let's
 

749
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,470
right probably not worth it um but let's
see what else we got here okay
