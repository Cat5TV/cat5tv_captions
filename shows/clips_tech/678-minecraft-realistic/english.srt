has a lot to do with how light reflects

158
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
has a lot to do with how light reflects

off the water
and how water refracts the light shaders

and that causes blocks beneath the

and that causes blocks beneath the
 

167
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,750
and that causes blocks beneath the
surface to have an authentic

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,870
seen the difference between
a shader and a resource pack so let's

302
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
a shader and a resource pack so let's
 

303
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,070
a shader and a resource pack so let's
combine both

304

combine both
 

305
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,830

here's a tip remember how umcea came in

this is because in older releases some

710
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
this is because in older releases some
 

711
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,750
this is because in older releases some
textures are missing

712

textures are missing
 

713
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,430
textures are missing
so the designer then creates those

714
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
so the designer then creates those
 

715
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,350
so the designer then creates those
textures and releases them separately

716
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
textures and releases them separately
 

717
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,990
textures and releases them separately
and by adding both release files you

718
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
and by adding both release files you
 

719
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,949
and by adding both release files you
then get

720
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
then get
 

721
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,590
then get
both sets of those textures making it

okay now that we've got an understanding

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
okay now that we've got an understanding
 

779
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,150
okay now that we've got an understanding
of resource packs and how to set them up

00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
of resource packs and how to set them up

let's take a look at shader packs there

782
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
let's take a look at shader packs there
 

783
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,990
let's take a look at shader packs there
are a few different types of shader

784
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
are a few different types of shader
 

785
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,430
are a few different types of shader
packs and some will work better than

786
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
packs and some will work better than
 

787
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,189
packs and some will work better than
others on certain hardware

788
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
others on certain hardware
 

789
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,430
others on certain hardware
it's fine to run it and if it doesn't

790
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
it's fine to run it and if it doesn't
 

791
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,590
it's fine to run it and if it doesn't
work you can simply remove it by turning

792
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
work you can simply remove it by turning
 

793
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,790
work you can simply remove it by turning
shaders off

794
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
shaders off
 

795
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,110

remove that shader
 

813
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,189
