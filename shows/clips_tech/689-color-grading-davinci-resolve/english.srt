bit higher than the
 

125
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,870
bit higher than the
red which is inevitable because i'm

126

you don't want this to be level across

132
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
you don't want this to be level across
 

133
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,310
you don't want this to be level across
the board because yeah there is more

134

the board because yeah there is more
 

135
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,590

blue in that picture
 

137
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,950
blue in that picture
but what i want to do now is i want to

138
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
but what i want to do now is i want to
 

139
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,710
but what i want to do now is i want to
correct the lighting ever so slightly

140
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
correct the lighting ever so slightly
 

141
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,830
correct the lighting ever so slightly
it's looking pretty

142
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
it's looking pretty
 

143
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,070
it's looking pretty
pretty good right out of the box but i

144
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
pretty good right out of the box but i
 

145
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,430
pretty good right out of the box but i
can bring up the gain

146
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
can bring up the gain
 

147
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,270
can bring up the gain
and what i want to watch is that i'm not

148
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
and what i want to watch is that i'm not
 

149
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,790
and what i want to watch is that i'm not
going to clip any of these

150
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
going to clip any of these
 

151
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,869
going to clip any of these
okay so by clipping i mean it's going to

152
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
okay so by clipping i mean it's going to
 

153
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,790
okay so by clipping i mean it's going to
go off of the scopes here so if i

154
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
go off of the scopes here so if i
 

155
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,710
go off of the scopes here so if i
actually bring that up too high

156
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
actually bring that up too high
 

157
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,630
actually bring that up too high
it's going to be see what happens to the

158
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
it's going to be see what happens to the
 

159
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,150
it's going to be see what happens to the
blue channel there and

160
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
blue channel there and
 

161
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,949
blue channel there and
it's it's like it's over saturated so i

162
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
it's it's like it's over saturated so i
 

163
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,869
it's it's like it's over saturated so i
want to keep these

164
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
want to keep these
 

165
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,150
want to keep these
spectrum analysis analyses

166
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
spectrum analysis analyses
 

167
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,790
spectrum analysis analyses
uh within this scope here i don't want

168
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
uh within this scope here i don't want
 

169
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,470
uh within this scope here i don't want
it to clip outside of that

170
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
it to clip outside of that
 

171
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,070
it to clip outside of that
but i want to bring it up so that the

172
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
but i want to bring it up so that the
 

173
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,509
but i want to bring it up so that the
lighting is a little more see if it's

174
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
lighting is a little more see if it's
 

175
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,550
lighting is a little more see if it's
too dark

176
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
too dark
 

177
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,670
too dark
it's going to look like that and you can

178
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
it's going to look like that and you can
 

179
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,830
it's going to look like that and you can
see how that affects those graphs

180
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
see how that affects those graphs
 

181
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,710
see how that affects those graphs
so i can visually see over there that

182
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
so i can visually see over there that
 

183
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,350
so i can visually see over there that
bringing up

184
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
bringing up
 

185
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,030
bringing up
so watch the blue there how i'm just

186
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
so watch the blue there how i'm just
 

187
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,030
so watch the blue there how i'm just
letting it touch the edge of the scope

188
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
letting it touch the edge of the scope
 

189
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,390
letting it touch the edge of the scope
i'm not going to go any further than

190
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
i'm not going to go any further than
 

191
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,150
i'm not going to go any further than
that because i don't want to clip it

192
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
that because i don't want to clip it
 

193
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,550
that because i don't want to clip it
so now if i wanted to i can see that

194
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
so now if i wanted to i can see that
 

195
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,190
so now if i wanted to i can see that
there is

196
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
there is
 

197
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,070
there is
very little green compared to blue and i

198
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
very little green compared to blue and i
 

199
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,830
very little green compared to blue and i
can experiment with okay if i want to

200
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
can experiment with okay if i want to
 

201
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,350
can experiment with okay if i want to
just grab the green a little bit

202
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
just grab the green a little bit
 

203
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,710
just grab the green a little bit
and just bring that up but i can see

204
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
and just bring that up but i can see
 

205
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,470
and just bring that up but i can see
that's actually skewing

206
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
that's actually skewing
 

207
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,229
that's actually skewing
the color but i want to you know see

208
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
the color but i want to you know see
 

209
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,589
the color but i want to you know see
what that does so

210
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
what that does so
 

211
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,229
what that does so
see how the the green and i'm looking

212
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
see how the the green and i'm looking
 

213
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,830
see how the the green and i'm looking
over here at the spectrum analysis

214
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
over here at the spectrum analysis
 

215
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,830
over here at the spectrum analysis
so how that affects that

216
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
so how that affects that
 

217
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,710
so how that affects that
so i can line things up so that

218
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
so i can line things up so that
 

219
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,589
so i can line things up so that
everything is

220
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
everything is
 

221
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,110
everything is
just right there we go so that's looking

222
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
just right there we go so that's looking
 

223
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,990
just right there we go so that's looking
pretty good

224
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
pretty good
 

225
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,830
pretty good
my offset is going to bring those down a

226
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
my offset is going to bring those down a
 

227
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,350
my offset is going to bring those down a
little bit into the darker end of the

228
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
little bit into the darker end of the
 

229
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,470
little bit into the darker end of the
spectrum so that i can

230
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
spectrum so that i can
 

231
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,229
spectrum so that i can
expand them a little bit further if i

232
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
expand them a little bit further if i
 

233
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,229
expand them a little bit further if i
need to but you don't want to

234
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
need to but you don't want to
 

235
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,710
need to but you don't want to
over kill it because you don't want it

236
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
over kill it because you don't want it
 

237
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,509
over kill it because you don't want it
to look

238
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
to look
 

239
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,190
to look
like it's been overly enhanced or

240
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
like it's been overly enhanced or
 

241
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,949
like it's been overly enhanced or
digitized but i can

242
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
digitized but i can
 

243
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,589
digitized but i can
correct certain aspects of lighting now

244
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
correct certain aspects of lighting now
 

245
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:45,990
correct certain aspects of lighting now
lighting

246
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
lighting
 

247
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,270
lighting
is pretty good in our studio but

248
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
is pretty good in our studio but
 

249
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,110
is pretty good in our studio but
you know i get a lot of glare off my

250
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
you know i get a lot of glare off my
 

251
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,030
you know i get a lot of glare off my
forehead and stuff like that so

252
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
forehead and stuff like that so
 

253
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,910
forehead and stuff like that so
i can correct that here okay so next

254
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
i can correct that here okay so next
 

255
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,309
i can correct that here okay so next
step

256
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
step
 

257
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,429
step
is actually to correct some of the

258
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
is actually to correct some of the
 

259
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,309
is actually to correct some of the
details

260
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
details
 

261
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,429
details
in my flesh so

262
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
in my flesh so
 

263
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,630
in my flesh so
and this could be not only um my actual

264
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
and this could be not only um my actual
 

265
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,750
and this could be not only um my actual
skin

266
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
skin
 

267
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,070
skin
like if i have blemishes for example

268
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
like if i have blemishes for example
 

269
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,990
like if i have blemishes for example
pimples or something like that

270
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
pimples or something like that
 

271
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,830
pimples or something like that
um you can see there's a little bit of a

272
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
um you can see there's a little bit of a
 

273
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,990
um you can see there's a little bit of a
red spot on my forehead here

274
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
red spot on my forehead here
 

275
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,270
red spot on my forehead here
um so i can correct that as well

276
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
um so i can correct that as well
 

277
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,990
um so i can correct that as well
but it can also be to compensate for

278
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
but it can also be to compensate for
 

279
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,270
but it can also be to compensate for
some of the graininess

280
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
some of the graininess
 

281
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,629
some of the graininess
of your camera you can see that the

282
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
of your camera you can see that the
 

283
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,550
of your camera you can see that the
actual camera itself

284
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
actual camera itself
 

285
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,189
actual camera itself
is a little bit pixelated so what i'm

286
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
is a little bit pixelated so what i'm
 

287
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,909
is a little bit pixelated so what i'm
going to do

288
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
going to do
 

289
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,790
going to do
observe that spot on my forehead in

290
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
observe that spot on my forehead in
 

291
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,070
observe that spot on my forehead in
particular

292
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
particular
 

293
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,310
particular
some of the some of my goatee here you

294
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
some of the some of my goatee here you
 

295
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,510
some of the some of my goatee here you
can see a a red spot there on my chin

296
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
can see a a red spot there on my chin
 

297
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,310
can see a a red spot there on my chin
which looks like a blemish on my face

298
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
which looks like a blemish on my face
 

299
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,749
which looks like a blemish on my face
there's another one right

300
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
there's another one right
 

301
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,950
there's another one right
on this side here so let's let's see

302
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
on this side here so let's let's see
 

303
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,870
on this side here so let's let's see
what we can do to correct that and and

304
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
what we can do to correct that and and
 

305
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,469
what we can do to correct that and and
we're not getting into

306
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
we're not getting into
 

307
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,310
we're not getting into
this is not a de facto um how to color

308
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
this is not a de facto um how to color
 

309
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,830
this is not a de facto um how to color
correct in davinci resolve there are

310
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
correct in davinci resolve there are
 

311
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,950
correct in davinci resolve there are
tons of those

312
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
tons of those
 

313
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,310
tons of those
on youtube so consider this more how

314
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320

so i am gonna have to do some tracking

388
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
so i am gonna have to do some tracking
 

389
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,350
so i am gonna have to do some tracking
so let's bring up our tracking tool

390
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
so let's bring up our tracking tool
 

391
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,270
so let's bring up our tracking tool
and i'm gonna hit play from the

392
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
and i'm gonna hit play from the
 

393
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,950
and i'm gonna hit play from the
beginning and that's actually going to

394
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
beginning and that's actually going to
 

395
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,830
beginning and that's actually going to
track my face

396
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
track my face
 

397
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,830
track my face
there we go so it's it's following my

398
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
there we go so it's it's following my
 

399
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,870
there we go so it's it's following my
face now

400
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
face now
 

401
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,070
face now
i'm not happy with the way that it's

402
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
i'm not happy with the way that it's
 

403
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,070
i'm not happy with the way that it's
the way that it's tracking there you see

404
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
the way that it's tracking there you see
 

405
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,749
the way that it's tracking there you see
what it's what it actually did is it

406
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
what it's what it actually did is it
 

407
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:33,990
what it's what it actually did is it
kind

408
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
kind

of went askew so i'm going to change so
 

411
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,350
of went askew so i'm going to change so
that it

412
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
that it
 

413
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,150
that it
it does not rotate it does not enter 3d

space
and it does not zoom because the camera

418
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
and it does not zoom because the camera
 

419
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,309
and it does not zoom because the camera
is stationary

420
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
is stationary
 

421
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,430
is stationary
all i want it to do is uh and let's turn

422
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
all i want it to do is uh and let's turn
 

423
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,990
all i want it to do is uh and let's turn
off

424
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
off
 

425
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,670
off
tilt let's just go with pan

426
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
tilt let's just go with pan
 

427
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,909
tilt let's just go with pan
and let's try that so i've undone now

428
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
and let's try that so i've undone now
 

429
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,189
and let's try that so i've undone now
i'm gonna hit trace

430
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
i'm gonna hit trace
 

431
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,790
i'm gonna hit trace
and see now it's just moving left and

432
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
and see now it's just moving left and
 

433
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,469
and see now it's just moving left and
right did you see that

434
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
right did you see that
 

435
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,309
right did you see that
so ignore the fact that it changes to

436
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
so ignore the fact that it changes to
 

437
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,070
so ignore the fact that it changes to
the computer shot so now

438
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
the computer shot so now
 

439
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,469
the computer shot so now
that my tracking is done and i'm just

440

moving back and forth here and you can
 

443
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,629
moving back and forth here and you can
see that it's

444
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
see that it's
 

445
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,830

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
far to the side there that
 

449
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,350
far to the side there that
tracks my face so uh now that the

450
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
tracks my face so uh now that the
 

451
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,070
tracks my face so uh now that the
tracking is done

tracking is done
so if i go back to my circle tool here

454
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
so if i go back to my circle tool here
 

455
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,710

subtle air brushing you don't want to go
too far and yet i have

490
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
too far and yet i have
 

491
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,189
too far and yet i have
let's bring that up just a little bit

492
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
let's bring that up just a little bit
 

493
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,749
let's bring that up just a little bit
and you can see that the detail

494
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
and you can see that the detail
 

495
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,869
and you can see that the detail
is just a little bit softened

496
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
is just a little bit softened
 

497
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,230
is just a little bit softened
but it looks natural so now with that

498
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
but it looks natural so now with that
 

499
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,950
but it looks natural so now with that
tracking happening if i press play

500
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960

 

501
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,469

it's actually going to do that

502
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
it's actually going to do that
 

503
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,029
it's actually going to do that
feathering

504
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039

 

505
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,790

and it's going to follow my face i can

506
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
and it's going to follow my face i can
 

507
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,629
and it's going to follow my face i can
still see the forehead thing that's

508
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
still see the forehead thing that's
 

509
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,350
still see the forehead thing that's
not not too bad of a thing if i wanted

510
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
not not too bad of a thing if i wanted
 

511
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,150
not not too bad of a thing if i wanted
to

512
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
to
 

513
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,550
to
because that's a red spot and this is

514
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
because that's a red spot and this is
 

515
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,430
because that's a red spot and this is
going to be different for

516
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
going to be different for
 

517
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,589
going to be different for
every single video that i produce but

518
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
every single video that i produce but
 

519
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,950
every single video that i produce but
here yeah i do

520
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
here yeah i do
 

521
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,710
here yeah i do
have a red spot on my head for some

522
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
have a red spot on my head for some
 

523
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,710
have a red spot on my head for some
reason so i could actually create

524
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
reason so i could actually create
 

525
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,350
reason so i could actually create
another

526
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
another
 

527
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,430
another
parallel node and i could create another

528
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
parallel node and i could create another
 

529
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,350
parallel node and i could create another
circle and i could place

530
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
circle and i could place
 

531
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,070
circle and i could place
that circle on that red spot

532
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
that circle on that red spot
 

533
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,310
that circle on that red spot
keep the feather and just place it like

534
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
keep the feather and just place it like
 

535
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,670
keep the feather and just place it like
right there

536
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
right there
 

537
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,870
right there
and let's actually track that red spot

538
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
and let's actually track that red spot
 

539
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,710
and let's actually track that red spot
so let's put it right there and

540
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
so let's put it right there and
 

541
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,829
so let's put it right there and
follow

542
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839

 

543
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,910

okay so now i've tracked that red spot

544
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
okay so now i've tracked that red spot
 

545
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,430
okay so now i've tracked that red spot
so it's following it

546
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
so it's following it
 

547
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,949
so it's following it
and let's see if we can very gently

548
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
and let's see if we can very gently
 

549
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,990
and let's see if we can very gently
bring down the red just a little bit

550
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
bring down the red just a little bit
 

551
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,430
bring down the red just a little bit
so i'm going to grab here and pull down

552
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
so i'm going to grab here and pull down
 

553
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,990
so i'm going to grab here and pull down
the red so if i pull down too far watch

554
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
the red so if i pull down too far watch
 

555
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,350
the red so if i pull down too far watch
what happens see that

556
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
what happens see that
 

557
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,750
what happens see that
uh so it's actually so now if i play

558
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
uh so it's actually so now if i play
 

559
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,750
uh so it's actually so now if i play
that

560
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
that
 

561
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,550
that
see it's following and it's i'm turning

562
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
see it's following and it's i'm turning
 

563
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,269
see it's following and it's i'm turning
it green

564
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
it green
 

565
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,870
it green
so you don't want to go down that far

566
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
so you don't want to go down that far
 

567
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,470
so you don't want to go down that far
but if you can do it just

568
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
but if you can do it just
 

569
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,070
but if you can do it just
subtly enough and yet

570
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
subtly enough and yet
 

571
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,910
subtly enough and yet
strong enough that it makes an impact

572
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
strong enough that it makes an impact
 

573
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,350
strong enough that it makes an impact
it's not going to be perfect i'm not

574
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
it's not going to be perfect i'm not
 

575
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,190
it's not going to be perfect i'm not
going all out here and spending hours

576
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
going all out here and spending hours
 

577
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,110
going all out here and spending hours
and hours retouching a video

578
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
and hours retouching a video
 

579
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,990
and hours retouching a video
no i'm doing really simple touch-ups

580
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
no i'm doing really simple touch-ups
 

581
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,509
no i'm doing really simple touch-ups
really really quickly

582
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
really really quickly
 

583
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,630
really really quickly
so now if we look at that video

584
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
so now if we look at that video
 

585
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,110
so now if we look at that video
and let's select our main node that's a

586
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
and let's select our main node that's a
 

587
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,949
and let's select our main node that's a
little bit too pronounced i don't like

588
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
little bit too pronounced i don't like
 

589
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,350
little bit too pronounced i don't like
that

590
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
that
 

591
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,269
that
so i'm going to bring up the red just a

592
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
so i'm going to bring up the red just a
 

593
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,350
so i'm going to bring up the red just a
bit let's see if i can find kind of a

594
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
bit let's see if i can find kind of a
 

595
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,470
bit let's see if i can find kind of a
happy medium

596
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
happy medium
 

597
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,710
happy medium
that looks pretty clean so now if i

598
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
that looks pretty clean so now if i
 

599
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,750
that looks pretty clean so now if i
press play

600
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
press play
 

601
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,910
press play
you can see it's actually following the

602
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
you can see it's actually following the
 

603
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,230
you can see it's actually following the
the spot and it's following my face

604
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
the spot and it's following my face
 

605
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,190
the spot and it's following my face
so that whole track is looking a heck of

606
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
so that whole track is looking a heck of
 

607
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,150
so that whole track is looking a heck of
a lot better

608
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
a lot better
 

609
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,710
a lot better
right out the gate so again if i so

610
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
right out the gate so again if i so
 

611
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,550
right out the gate so again if i so
let's turn off

612
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
let's turn off
 

613
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,710
let's turn off
both of those so this is the original

614
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
both of those so this is the original
 

615
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,230
both of those so this is the original
video

616
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
video
 

617
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,630
video
and i've only spent a couple of seconds

618
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
and i've only spent a couple of seconds
 

619
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,590
and i've only spent a couple of seconds
here so now

620
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
here so now
 

621
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,470
here so now
turn back on both of these and look at

622
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
turn back on both of these and look at
 

623
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,030
turn back on both of these and look at
the difference

624
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
the difference
 

625
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,069
the difference
fantastic okay so next up here's

626
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
fantastic okay so next up here's
 

627
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,750
fantastic okay so next up here's
something that we're going to do for the

628
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
something that we're going to do for the
 

629
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,750
something that we're going to do for the
sake of today's demonstration but i want

630
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
sake of today's demonstration but i want
 

631
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,350
sake of today's demonstration but i want
you to hold off on this if you want to

632
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
you to hold off on this if you want to
 

633
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,310
you to hold off on this if you want to
do multicam

634
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
do multicam
 

635
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,949
do multicam
shots from a single camera that's a

636
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
shots from a single camera that's a
 

637
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,150
shots from a single camera that's a
feature that we're going to be doing

638
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
feature that we're going to be doing
 

639
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,269
feature that we're going to be doing
next time

640
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
next time
 

641
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,750
next time
so hold on the vignettes if you're going

642
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
so hold on the vignettes if you're going
 

643
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,949
so hold on the vignettes if you're going
to be doing that because i've got a

644
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
to be doing that because i've got a
 

645
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,790
to be doing that because i've got a
trick for you but because this is a

646
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
trick for you but because this is a
 

647
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,150
trick for you but because this is a
single camera shot

648
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
single camera shot
 

649
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,750
single camera shot
i'm actually going to create a serial

650
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
i'm actually going to create a serial
 

651
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,670
i'm actually going to create a serial
node which is alt

652
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
node which is alt
 

653
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,670
node which is alt
s and that serial node is going to now

654
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
s and that serial node is going to now
 

655
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,470
s and that serial node is going to now
have

656
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
have
 

657
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,150
have
a vignette so i'm going to click into

658
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
a vignette so i'm going to click into
 

659
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,829
a vignette so i'm going to click into
my uh window mode and click on a circle

660
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
my uh window mode and click on a circle
 

661
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,750
my uh window mode and click on a circle
once again we love circles

662
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
once again we love circles

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,389
once again we love circles
i got a big round melon of a head so it

664
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
i got a big round melon of a head so it
 

665
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,750
i got a big round melon of a head so it
works really really well

666
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
works really really well
 

667
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,590
works really really well
uh so pretend this is a camera lens so

668
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
uh so pretend this is a camera lens so
 

669
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,430
uh so pretend this is a camera lens so
see i'm doing this proportionally

670
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
see i'm doing this proportionally
 

671
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,389
see i'm doing this proportionally
and i want to bring it out like that and

672
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
and i want to bring it out like that and
 

673
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,389
and i want to bring it out like that and
feather the edge

674
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
feather the edge
 

675
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,750
feather the edge
by grabbing the corner it's going to be

676
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
by grabbing the corner it's going to be
 

677
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,710
by grabbing the corner it's going to be
proportional so remember the camera lens

678
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
proportional so remember the camera lens
 

679
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,829
proportional so remember the camera lens
being perfectly

680
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
being perfectly
 

681
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,110

circular we want to do that without

682
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
circular we want to do that without
 

683
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,470
circular we want to do that without
skewing it too much so

684
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
skewing it too much so
 

685
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,590
skewing it too much so
now if i bring down the gain

686
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
now if i bring down the gain
 

687
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,190
now if i bring down the gain
quite a bit look at what it does it

688
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
quite a bit look at what it does it
 

689
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,870
quite a bit look at what it does it
turns down the brightness but now

690
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
turns down the brightness but now
 

691
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,750
turns down the brightness but now
invert that circle and now we've got

692
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
invert that circle and now we've got
 

693
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,150
invert that circle and now we've got
this nice vignette around the edge

694
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
this nice vignette around the edge
 

695
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,310
this nice vignette around the edge
so if i turn that off that's what it

696
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
so if i turn that off that's what it
 

697
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,509
so if i turn that off that's what it
looks like without

698
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
looks like without
 

699
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,430
looks like without
and that's what it looks like with and

700
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
and that's what it looks like with and
 

701
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,750
and that's what it looks like with and
that vignette is now applied

702
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
that vignette is now applied
 

703
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,069
that vignette is now applied
as a serial node so it's going to stay

704
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
as a serial node so it's going to stay
 

705
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,829
as a serial node so it's going to stay
there through the whole video so now if

706
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
there through the whole video so now if
 

707
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,550
there through the whole video so now if
i press play

708
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
i press play
 

709
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,670
i press play
it now looks like that

710
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680

 

711
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,190

so that is very basic color grading it

712
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
so that is very basic color grading it
 

713

and then you can kind of take it one

732
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
and then you can kind of take it one
 

733
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,590
and then you can kind of take it one
step further you saw the red spot on my

734

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
node uh a parallel node pardon me and
 

765
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,949
node uh a parallel node pardon me and
remove that spot so by increasing the
