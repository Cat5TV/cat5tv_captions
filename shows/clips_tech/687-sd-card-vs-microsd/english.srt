and thank you brian for the question you

76
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
and thank you brian for the question you
 

77
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,030
and thank you brian for the question you
know the difference between an

78
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
know the difference between an
 

79
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,429
know the difference between an
sd and a micro sd card there really

80
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
sd and a micro sd card there really
 

81
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,270
sd and a micro sd card there really
isn't that much of a difference at all

82
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
isn't that much of a difference at all
 

83
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,270
isn't that much of a difference at all
it's really just about the size

84
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
it's really just about the size
 

85
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,070
it's really just about the size
so capacities generally are the same and

86
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
so capacities generally are the same and
 

87
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,469
so capacities generally are the same and
then

88
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
then
 

89
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,469
then
if you're talking about performance now

90
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
if you're talking about performance now

if you're talking about performance now
the one thing you want to be concerned

the one thing you want to be concerned
 

93
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,230
the one thing you want to be concerned
about

94
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
about
 

95
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,390
about
is that some of the lower capacity sd

96
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
is that some of the lower capacity sd
 

97
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,069
is that some of the lower capacity sd
and micro sd cards

98
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
and micro sd cards
 

99
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,550
and micro sd cards
are going to be just a little bit slower

100
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
are going to be just a little bit slower
 

101
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,230
are going to be just a little bit slower
than the higher capacity

102
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
than the higher capacity
 

103
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,990
than the higher capacity
the reason why is it's more on the

104
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
the reason why is it's more on the
 

105
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,510
the reason why is it's more on the
engineering backend side

106
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
engineering backend side
 

107
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,990
engineering backend side
you know the higher capacity sd and

108
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
you know the higher capacity sd and
 

109
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,190
you know the higher capacity sd and
micro sd cards

110
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
micro sd cards
 

111
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,350
micro sd cards
sometimes they have more chips inside of

112
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
sometimes they have more chips inside of
 

113
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,590
sometimes they have more chips inside of
it so that means there's more chips for

114
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
it so that means there's more chips for
 

115
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,270
it so that means there's more chips for
the controller to address

116
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
the controller to address
 

117
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,230
the controller to address
if we think of this as like the freeway

118
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
if we think of this as like the freeway
 

119
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,550
if we think of this as like the freeway
in

120
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
in
 

121
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,950
in
traffic well the more lanes on the

122
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
traffic well the more lanes on the
 

123
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,469
traffic well the more lanes on the
freeway the faster

124
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
freeway the faster
 

125
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,709
freeway the faster
the cars can move so that's really what

126
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
the cars can move so that's really what
 

127
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,389
the cars can move so that's really what
we're talking about when it comes to

128
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
we're talking about when it comes to
 

129
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,350
we're talking about when it comes to
performance

130
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
performance
 

131
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,749
performance
wow okay so the larger the capacity of

132
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
wow okay so the larger the capacity of
 

133
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,270
wow okay so the larger the capacity of
the card presumably

134
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
the card presumably
 

135
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,789
the card presumably
the faster it's going to be that's

136
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
the faster it's going to be that's
 

137
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,029
the faster it's going to be that's
interesting okay cool thanks dave

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
like you know this one looks like it's
 

147
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,309
like you know this one looks like it's
such a little tiny thin little thing and

148
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
such a little tiny thin little thing and
 

149
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,309
such a little tiny thin little thing and
this one's got a little more heft to it

150
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
this one's got a little more heft to it
 

151
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,309
this one's got a little more heft to it
do i have to worry about this one with

152
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
do i have to worry about this one with
 

153
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,309
do i have to worry about this one with
like heat for example like if i have

this dave if i may
uh i've got these adapters that will

184
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
uh i've got these adapters that will
 

185

convert my micro sd card

186
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
convert my micro sd card
 

187
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,309
convert my micro sd card
into a full sized sd and it feels like a

188
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
into a full sized sd and it feels like a
 

189
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,070
into a full sized sd and it feels like a
full-sized sd at that point

190
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
full-sized sd at that point
 

191
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,710
full-sized sd at that point
is this affecting the performance of my

192
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
is this affecting the performance of my
 

193
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,350
is this affecting the performance of my
card

194
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
card
 

195
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,509
card
it's a pat the adapter is passive so

196
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
it's a pat the adapter is passive so
 

197
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,509
it's a pat the adapter is passive so
when you put that micro sd card into the

198
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
when you put that micro sd card into the
 

199
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,790
when you put that micro sd card into the
sd adapter

200
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
sd adapter
 

201
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,869
sd adapter
that's really more of a flexibility

202
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
that's really more of a flexibility
 

203
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,350
that's really more of a flexibility
thing there so let's say your device

204
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
thing there so let's say your device
 

205
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,630
thing there so let's say your device
uses a micro sd card but the laptop that

206
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
uses a micro sd card but the laptop that
 

207
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,710
uses a micro sd card but the laptop that
you have only has an sd slot

208
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
you have only has an sd slot
 

209
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,030
you have only has an sd slot
well that's why some companies will ship

210
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
well that's why some companies will ship
 

211
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,630
well that's why some companies will ship
an sd card adapter with it

212
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
an sd card adapter with it
 

213
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,229

217
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,190
offload that data from the device
into your computer so that's really what

218
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
into your computer so that's really what
 

219
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,509

223
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,910
