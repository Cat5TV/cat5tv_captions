00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,550
uh i've got no larynx i've got nothing
there

168
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
there
 

169
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,110
there
okay uh i've got all this i got all the

170
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
okay uh i've got all this i got all the
 

171
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,830
okay uh i've got all this i got all the
uh

172
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
uh
 

173
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,830
uh
uh wave changings up in my mouth

174
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
uh wave changings up in my mouth
 

175
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,949
uh wave changings up in my mouth
otherwise mouth feed lips

176
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
otherwise mouth feed lips
 

177
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,470
otherwise mouth feed lips
etc

178
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480

 

179
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,509

but uh there's over the back of my

180
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
but uh there's over the back of my
 

181
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,589
but uh there's over the back of my
down my throat is called a tea muscle

182
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
down my throat is called a tea muscle
 

183
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,309
down my throat is called a tea muscle
which is a big wrong rubber band

184
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
which is a big wrong rubber band
 

185
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,509
which is a big wrong rubber band
so it it the way for me to actually not

186
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
so it it the way for me to actually not
 

187
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,390
so it it the way for me to actually not
uh sign wave like the the vocal chords

188
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
uh sign wave like the the vocal chords
 

189
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,190
uh sign wave like the the vocal chords
it's either

190
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
it's either
 

191
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,830
it's either
more rectangular or more triangular

192
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
more rectangular or more triangular
 

193
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,110
more rectangular or more triangular
properly

194
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
properly
 

195
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,830
properly
and uh so it acts like the vocal chords

196
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
and uh so it acts like the vocal chords
 

197
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:07,350
and uh so it acts like the vocal chords
then right it's what vibrates

198
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360

 

199
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,949

as well because they've got this sort of

200
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
as well because they've got this sort of
 

201
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,670
as well because they've got this sort of
50s modulation on top of me

202
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
50s modulation on top of me
 

203
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,030
50s modulation on top of me
so i'm trying to

204
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040

 

205
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,030

it took a long time for 20 years to do

206
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
it took a long time for 20 years to do
 

207
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,550
it took a long time for 20 years to do
it

208
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
it
 

209
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,469
it
but can you you can't do that in real

210
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
but can you you can't do that in real
 

211
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,590
but can you you can't do that in real
time though can you

212
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
time though can you
 

213
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,070
time though can you
i mean you have to record it process it

214
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
i mean you have to record it process it
 

215
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,950
i mean you have to record it process it
and then play it back well that's what

216
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
and then play it back well that's what
 

217
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,550
and then play it back well that's what
we're thinking about the electronics

218
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
we're thinking about the electronics
 

219
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,390
we're thinking about the electronics
that's where i i might need some help

220
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
that's where i i might need some help
 

221
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,670
that's where i i might need some help
from somebody

222
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
from somebody
 

223
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,550
from somebody
uh uh and to build in something uh

224
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
uh uh and to build in something uh
 

225
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,469
uh uh and to build in something uh
trying to design something

226
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
trying to design something
 

227
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,629
trying to design something
uh uh it probably might need something

228
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
uh uh it probably might need something
 

229
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,990
uh uh it probably might need something
like a um

230
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000

 

231
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,310

well and not not to apply rolls required

232
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
well and not not to apply rolls required
 

233
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,749
well and not not to apply rolls required
something could be better than a lot of

234
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
something could be better than a lot of
 

235
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,310
something could be better than a lot of
people i

236
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
people i
 

237
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,510
people i
would think of the process in power

238
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
would think of the process in power
 

239
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,310
would think of the process in power
because you need a lot of processing and

240
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
because you need a lot of processing and
 

241
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,390
because you need a lot of processing and
around the algorithm uh

242
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
around the algorithm uh
 

243
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,430
around the algorithm uh
on there and uh use the audio card on

244
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
on there and uh use the audio card on
 

245
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,629
on there and uh use the audio card on
that to to keep

that to to keep
contingency uh in real time at the very

248
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
contingency uh in real time at the very
 

249
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,070
contingency uh in real time at the very
least no matter how strong your hardware

250
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
least no matter how strong your hardware
 

251
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,070
least no matter how strong your hardware
is you're gonna get some kind of a delay

252
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
is you're gonna get some kind of a delay
 

253
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,110
is you're gonna get some kind of a delay
because it takes some finite amount of

254
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
because it takes some finite amount of
 

255
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,510
because it takes some finite amount of
time

256
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
time
 

257
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,870
time
to read it for the listener

258
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
to read it for the listener
 

259
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,070
to read it for the listener
it will be about one second i reckon

260
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
it will be about one second i reckon
 

261
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,510
it will be about one second i reckon
right right because these these headsets

262
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
right right because these these headsets
 

263
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,590
right right because these these headsets
or this headset is a noise cancelling

264
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
or this headset is a noise cancelling
 

265
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,629
or this headset is a noise cancelling
headset

headset
 

267
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,590
headset
and um the noise cancelling headset

268
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
and um the noise cancelling headset
 

269
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,029
and um the noise cancelling headset
always has some kind of

270
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
always has some kind of
 

271
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,469
always has some kind of
a hiss to it because i'm not sure why

272
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
a hiss to it because i'm not sure why
 

273
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,070
a hiss to it because i'm not sure why
you're arching your hands like that is

274
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
you're arching your hands like that is
 

275
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,430
you're arching your hands like that is
there a reason for that

276
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
there a reason for that
 

277
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:48,230
there a reason for that
okay i

278

like they keep saying that because of
 

285
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,510
like they keep saying that because of
god without that didn't get it

um yeah the older um
1.2 uh series uh had the

612
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
1.2 uh series uh had the
 

613
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,230
1.2 uh series uh had the
didn't have it didn't support uh tls

614
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
didn't have it didn't support uh tls
 

615
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,069
didn't have it didn't support uh tls
what uh 1.2

616
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
what uh 1.2
 

617
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,030
what uh 1.2
so yeah yeah or it supported it but it

618
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
so yeah yeah or it supported it but it
 

619
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,949
so yeah yeah or it supported it but it
defaulted to a tls one

620
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
defaulted to a tls one
 

621
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,910
defaulted to a tls one
and that was enough for uh some clients

622
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
and that was enough for uh some clients
 

623
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,470
and that was enough for uh some clients
to

624
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
to
 

625
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,670
to
nope i'm not doing that because yeah

626
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
nope i'm not doing that because yeah
 

627
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,790
nope i'm not doing that because yeah
yep yep yep i think even

628
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
yep yep yep i think even
 

629
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,150
yep yep yep i think even
even prior to tls wasn't it ssl prior to

630
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
even prior to tls wasn't it ssl prior to
 

631
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,870
even prior to tls wasn't it ssl prior to
that

632
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
that
 

633
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,110
that
and i think the old i think the old

634
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
and i think the old i think the old
 

635
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,430
and i think the old i think the old
client was using ssl and that's

636
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
client was using ssl and that's
 

637
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,509
client was using ssl and that's
that's what was well maybe it was tls

638
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
that's what was well maybe it was tls
 

639
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,870
that's what was well maybe it was tls
1.0 but

640
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
1.0 but
 

641
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,150
1.0 but
yeah she didn't last one at

642
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
yeah she didn't last one at
 

643
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,670
yeah she didn't last one at
20 years old okay it probably was tls

644
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
20 years old okay it probably was tls
 

645
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,389

00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
a drive that's inside it so i tried that
 

823
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,189
a drive that's inside it so i tried that
and it was slow understandably because

824
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
and it was slow understandably because
 

825
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,110
and it was slow understandably because
it's running off an sd card which runs

826
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
it's running off an sd card which runs
 

827
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,829
it's running off an sd card which runs
about

828
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
about
 

829
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,710
about
a quarter of the speed of what the emmc

830
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
a quarter of the speed of what the emmc
 

831
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,669
a quarter of the speed of what the emmc
runs

832
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
runs
 

833
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,470
runs
how fast it can run on the emmc but it

834
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
how fast it can run on the emmc but it
 

835
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,549
how fast it can run on the emmc but it
looked a whole lot better than what i'm

836
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
looked a whole lot better than what i'm
 

837
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,390
looked a whole lot better than what i'm
that than what i than what ub ports did

838
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
that than what i than what ub ports did
 

839
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,549
that than what i than what ub ports did
mobian looked a lot more like what i

840
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
mobian looked a lot more like what i
 

841
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,630
mobian looked a lot more like what i
expected the pine phone to be that is

842
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
expected the pine phone to be that is
 

843
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,510
expected the pine phone to be that is
basically

844
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
basically
 

845
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,270
basically
a linux box that lets you

846
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
a linux box that lets you
 

847
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,510
a linux box that lets you
take and take and make phone calls and

848
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
take and take and make phone calls and
 

849
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,549
take and take and make phone calls and
text messages and all that

850
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
text messages and all that
 

851
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,750
text messages and all that
but it also suffered from the problem

852
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
but it also suffered from the problem
 

853
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,630
but it also suffered from the problem
where it won't

854
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
where it won't
 

855
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,190
where it won't
identify incoming callers

856
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
identify incoming callers
 

857
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,590
identify incoming callers
so i thought well that's no good i so my

858
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
so i thought well that's no good i so my
 

859
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,950
so i thought well that's no good i so my
choices were to go

860
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
choices were to go
 

861
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,150
choices were to go
big through the

862
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
big through the
 

863
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,150
big through the
telephone stack to figure out how all

864
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
telephone stack to figure out how all
 

865
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,750
telephone stack to figure out how all
these hooks worked

866
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
these hooks worked
 

867
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,470
these hooks worked
or to just try another distro and see if

868
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
or to just try another distro and see if
 

869
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,470
or to just try another distro and see if
i could find one that worked and i kept

870
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
i could find one that worked and i kept
 

871
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,430
i could find one that worked and i kept
seeing

872
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
seeing
 

873
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,830
seeing
all over the place oh by the way i use

874
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
all over the place oh by the way i use
 

875
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,270
all over the place oh by the way i use
arch linux

876
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
arch linux
 

877
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,750
arch linux
i thought well okay what's this arch

878
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
i thought well okay what's this arch
 

879
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,029
i thought well okay what's this arch
linux thing

880
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
linux thing
 

881
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,630
linux thing
so i thought all right well i'll try it

882
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
so i thought all right well i'll try it
 

883
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,029
so i thought all right well i'll try it
yeah i mean i tried it i tried mobian

884
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
yeah i mean i tried it i tried mobian
 

885
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,590
yeah i mean i tried it i tried mobian
and

886
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
and
 

887
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,669
and
it was okay let's try arch and see what

888
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
it was okay let's try arch and see what
 

889
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,310
it was okay let's try arch and see what
else work right out of the box

890
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
else work right out of the box
 

891
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,750
else work right out of the box
and um it it now identifies incoming

892
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
and um it it now identifies incoming
 

893
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,789
and um it it now identifies incoming
phone calls

894
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
phone calls
 

895
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,350
phone calls
takes phone calls even from a deep sleep

896
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
takes phone calls even from a deep sleep
 

897
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,110
takes phone calls even from a deep sleep
so even if the phone's been asleep

898
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
so even if the phone's been asleep
 

899
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,430
so even if the phone's been asleep
all this time one of the problems with a

900
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
all this time one of the problems with a
 

901
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,710
all this time one of the problems with a
lot of distros

902
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
lot of distros
 

903
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,190
lot of distros
is they keep the cell phone modem

904
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
is they keep the cell phone modem
 

905
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,630
is they keep the cell phone modem
running all the time

906
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
running all the time
 

907
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,390
running all the time
so when you keep that wi-fi and cell

908
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
so when you keep that wi-fi and cell
 

909
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,710
so when you keep that wi-fi and cell
phone modem running all the time

910
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
phone modem running all the time
 

911
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,390
phone modem running all the time
you burn a lot of energy out of the

912
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
you burn a lot of energy out of the
 

913
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,150
you burn a lot of energy out of the
battery right and so

914
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
battery right and so
 

915
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,510
battery right and so
typically typically these won't stay

916
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
typically typically these won't stay
 

917
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,230
typically typically these won't stay
alive on battery more than a few hours

918
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
alive on battery more than a few hours
 

919
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,789
alive on battery more than a few hours
hours

920
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
hours
 

921
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,070
hours
maybe at maximum um

922
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
maybe at maximum um
 

923
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,510
maybe at maximum um
but when it you know these

924
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
but when it you know these
 

925
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,510
but when it you know these
uh both mobian and um arch linux

926
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
uh both mobian and um arch linux
 

927
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,870
uh both mobian and um arch linux
both shut down the um

928
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
both shut down the um
 

929
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,870
both shut down the um
the internal uh cell phone and wi-fi

930
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
the internal uh cell phone and wi-fi
 

931
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,110
the internal uh cell phone and wi-fi
modems

932
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
modems
 

933
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,750
modems
but crucially

934
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
but crucially
 

935
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,110
but crucially
arch linux will wake up the phone

936
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
arch linux will wake up the phone
 

937
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,029
arch linux will wake up the phone
on an incoming phone call even if it's

938
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
on an incoming phone call even if it's
 

939
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,310
on an incoming phone call even if it's
in a deep sleep

940
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
in a deep sleep
 

941
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,070
in a deep sleep
and it will still answer the phone

942
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
and it will still answer the phone
 

943
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,510
and it will still answer the phone
mobian does not

944
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
mobian does not
 

945
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,909
mobian does not
or at least the version that was on this

946
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
or at least the version that was on this
 

947
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,430
or at least the version that was on this
phone that did not

948
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
phone that did not
 

949
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,549
phone that did not
so what would happen is that mobian um

950
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
so what would happen is that mobian um
 

951
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,350
so what would happen is that mobian um
would shut down the internal cell phone

952
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
would shut down the internal cell phone
 

953
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,470
would shut down the internal cell phone
modem

954
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
modem
 

955
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,549
modem
when the thing went to sleep which was

956
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
when the thing went to sleep which was
 

957
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,150
when the thing went to sleep which was
great for battery life because now it's

958
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
great for battery life because now it's
 

959
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,750
great for battery life because now it's
not burning all that energy from the

960
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
not burning all that energy from the
 

961
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,110
not burning all that energy from the
radios

962
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
radios
 

963
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,990
radios
but um then i would try and call it or

964
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
but um then i would try and call it or
 

965
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,590
but um then i would try and call it or
somebody would try and call the phone

966
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
somebody would try and call the phone
 

967
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,430
somebody would try and call the phone
and it just wouldn't respond

968
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
and it just wouldn't respond
 

969
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,590
and it just wouldn't respond
the phone would not wake up well that's

970
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
the phone would not wake up well that's
 

971
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,350
the phone would not wake up well that's
no good i need the thing to actually

972
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
no good i need the thing to actually
 

973
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,029
no good i need the thing to actually
answer phone calls when they come in

974
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
answer phone calls when they come in
 

975
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,190
answer phone calls when they come in
that's kind of important it's a phone

976
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
that's kind of important it's a phone
 

977
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,270
that's kind of important it's a phone
that's what it's for

978
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
that's what it's for
 

979
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,029
that's what it's for
so mostly my first uh

980
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
so mostly my first uh
 

981
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,149
so mostly my first uh
phones i had i had 20 years ago i had a

982
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
phones i had i had 20 years ago i had a
 

983
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,270
phones i had i had 20 years ago i had a
an erickson 318 um and it

984
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
an erickson 318 um and it

yeah i have not yet tried

1020
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
yeah i have not yet tried
 

1021

1023
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,710

yeah it tends to keep the the modems

1024
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
yeah it tends to keep the the modems
 

1025
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,270
yeah it tends to keep the the modems
alive

1026
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
alive
 

1027
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,190
alive
the radios alive when it's on the

1028
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
the radios alive when it's on the
 

1029
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,110
the radios alive when it's on the
charger i mean put it on the charger

1030
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
charger i mean put it on the charger
 

1031
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,549
charger i mean put it on the charger
when you go to bed you know

1032
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
when you go to bed you know
 

1033
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,390
when you go to bed you know
oh yeah yeah yeah that's exactly what i

1034
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
oh yeah yeah yeah that's exactly what i
 

1035
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,230
oh yeah yeah yeah that's exactly what i
do but as i said

1036
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
do but as i said
 

1037
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,750
do but as i said
before i installed uh arch linux

1038
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
before i installed uh arch linux
 

1039
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,430
before i installed uh arch linux
i'd have to put it on the charger all

1040
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
i'd have to put it on the charger all
 

1041
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,110
i'd have to put it on the charger all
the time because it would only run

1042
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
the time because it would only run
 

1043
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,870
the time because it would only run
for maybe six hours or so on the battery

1044
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
for maybe six hours or so on the battery
 

1045
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,070
for maybe six hours or so on the battery
but now with with arch linux and mobian

1046
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
but now with with arch linux and mobian
 

1047
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,310
but now with with arch linux and mobian
ii

1048
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
ii
 

1049
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,830
ii
i'll give my due credit um

1050
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
i'll give my due credit um
 

1051
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,270
i'll give my due credit um
it would last over a day now easily

1052
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
it would last over a day now easily
 

1053
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,830
it would last over a day now easily
in standby but so i wouldn't have put it

1054
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
in standby but so i wouldn't have put it
 

1055
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,669
in standby but so i wouldn't have put it
on the charger all the time

1056
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
on the charger all the time
 

1057
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,710
on the charger all the time
now it looks like i can just

1058
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
now it looks like i can just
 

1059
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,350
now it looks like i can just
run this during the day normally and

1060
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
run this during the day normally and
 

1061
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,190
run this during the day normally and
then put it on charger overnight but i

1062
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
then put it on charger overnight but i
 

1063
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,789
then put it on charger overnight but i
still wouldn't be too far away without

1064
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
still wouldn't be too far away without
 

1065
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,510
still wouldn't be too far away without
it with it

1066
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
it with it
 

1067
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,590
it with it
i wouldn't be too far away from a some

1068
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
i wouldn't be too far away from a some
 

1069
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,270
i wouldn't be too far away from a some
sort of a power source at any time

1070
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
sort of a power source at any time
 

1071
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,830
sort of a power source at any time
because

1072
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
because
 

1073
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,830
because
you know if you use it a lot and i think

1074
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
you know if you use it a lot and i think
 

1075
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,590
you know if you use it a lot and i think
this is true even with android phones if

1076
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
this is true even with android phones if
 

1077
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,350
this is true even with android phones if
you keep the screen on a lot

1078
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
you keep the screen on a lot
 

1079
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,070
you keep the screen on a lot
um then it burns through the battery

1080
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
um then it burns through the battery
 

1081
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,230
um then it burns through the battery
pretty quickly so yeah

1082
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
pretty quickly so yeah
 

1083
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,430
pretty quickly so yeah
it is what it is so and i'm still still

1084
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
it is what it is so and i'm still still
 

1085
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,350
it is what it is so and i'm still still
exploring it still bringing out what to

1086
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
exploring it still bringing out what to
 

1087
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,909
exploring it still bringing out what to
you know what it works but what's really

1088
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
you know what it works but what's really
 

1089
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,789
you know what it works but what's really
cool is i can ssh into it

1090
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
cool is i can ssh into it
 

1091
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,669
cool is i can ssh into it
and and use it like a regular computer

1092
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
and and use it like a regular computer
 

1093
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,669
and and use it like a regular computer
i'm looking at i'm looking at getting

1094
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
i'm looking at i'm looking at getting
 

1095
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,510
i'm looking at i'm looking at getting
in fact it's on the way i'm getting a

1096
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
in fact it's on the way i'm getting a
 

1097
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,990
in fact it's on the way i'm getting a
dock a usbc dock for it

1098
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
dock a usbc dock for it
 

1099
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,230
dock a usbc dock for it
and i'm going to plug a keyboard a mouse

1100
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
and i'm going to plug a keyboard a mouse
 

1101
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,149
and i'm going to plug a keyboard a mouse
and an hdmi cable in

1102
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
and an hdmi cable in
 

1103
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,070
and an hdmi cable in
and i should be able to plug it into the

1104
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
and i should be able to plug it into the
 

1105
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,070
and i should be able to plug it into the
bottom of the phone

1106
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
bottom of the phone
 

1107
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,149
bottom of the phone
and charge it while i'm using it like a

1108
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
and charge it while i'm using it like a
 

1109
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,990
and charge it while i'm using it like a
regular computer

1110
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
regular computer
 

1111
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,390
regular computer
now don't expect any performance now

1112
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
now don't expect any performance now
 

1113
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,750
now don't expect any performance now
this thing is going to have about the

1114
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
this thing is going to have about the
 

1115
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,310
this thing is going to have about the
performance of the original pine book

1116
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
performance of the original pine book
 

1117
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,310
performance of the original pine book
i believe it has the same processor as

1118
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
i believe it has the same processor as
 

1119
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,669
i believe it has the same processor as
the original pine book

1120
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
the original pine book
 

1121
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,669
the original pine book
so don't be looking for any kind of

1122
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
so don't be looking for any kind of
 

1123
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,789
so don't be looking for any kind of
performance now

1124
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
performance now
 

1125
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,470
performance now
but it it amazes me that i can just

1126
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
but it it amazes me that i can just
 

1127
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,430
but it it amazes me that i can just
run it i can ssh into it and run

1128
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,440
run it i can ssh into it and run
 

1129
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,470
run it i can ssh into it and run
programs on it

1130
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
programs on it
 

1131
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,510
programs on it
even desktop programs with the

1132
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
even desktop programs with the
 

1133
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,230
even desktop programs with the
with the usb-c port it should

1134
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
with the usb-c port it should
 

1135
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,710
with the usb-c port it should
share the display you know the hdmi out

1136
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
share the display you know the hdmi out
 

1137
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,310
share the display you know the hdmi out
should just

1138
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
should just
 

1139
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,390
should just
activate the display just like an

1140
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
activate the display just like an
 

1141
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,549
activate the display just like an
extended display like windows does

1142
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
extended display like windows does
 

1143
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,029
extended display like windows does
at least that's how i've seen it done on

1144
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
at least that's how i've seen it done on
 

1145
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,270
at least that's how i've seen it done on
on youtube so

1146
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,280
on youtube so
 

1147
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,110
on youtube so
so it must work right it's on the

1148
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
so it must work right it's on the
 

1149
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,230
so it must work right it's on the
internet so it must be right

1150
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
internet so it must be right
 

1151
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,230
internet so it must be right
but even if it's slower than one thing

1152
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
but even if it's slower than one thing
 

1153
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,070
but even if it's slower than one thing
you could you know

1154
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
you could you know
 

1155
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,470
you could you know
that one can do when one has a computer

1156
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
that one can do when one has a computer
 

1157
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,230
that one can do when one has a computer
with ssh and so on

1158
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,240
with ssh and so on
 

1159
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,029
with ssh and so on
is that um like this is that um on a

00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
is that um like this is that um on a
 

1161
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,070
is that um like this is that um on a
slow device

1162
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
slow device
 

1163
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,269

on the uh
 

1169
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,350
on the uh
fast system then it would display on on

if i can show it to you because um
 

1195
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,230
if i can show it to you because um
because uh i've done the tweak on it

you can go into settings on mobian

1198
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
you can go into settings on mobian
 

1199
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,310
you can go into settings on mobian
or on arch linux

i don't think you can do this with ub

1202
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
i don't think you can do this with ub
 

1203
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,190
i don't think you can do this with ub
ports but if you go into settings

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
ports but if you go into settings
 

1205
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,909
ports but if you go into settings
and then look for the display option tap

1206
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
and then look for the display option tap
 

1207
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,710
and then look for the display option tap
on that

1208
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
on that
 

1209
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,789
on that
you have the option then to switch to

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
you have the option then to switch to

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,909
you have the option then to switch to
100

1215
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,549

percent

1216
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
percent
 

1217
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,710
percent
as as it comes out of the box at 200

1218
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
as as it comes out of the box at 200
 

1219

as as it comes out of the box at 200
percent the icons are huge

1220
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
percent the icons are huge
 

1221
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,909
percent the icons are huge
the text is huge and you don't get much

1222
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
the text is huge and you don't get much
 

1223
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,590
the text is huge and you don't get much
real estate on the screen

1224
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600

 

1225
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,549

yeah yeah but if you um if you switch it

1226
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
yeah yeah but if you um if you switch it
 

1227
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,029
yeah yeah but if you um if you switch it
to

1228
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
to
 

1229
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,710
to
the 100 size or resolution

1230
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
the 100 size or resolution
 

1231
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,870
the 100 size or resolution
everything shrinks down to half the size

1232
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
everything shrinks down to half the size
 

1233
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,549
everything shrinks down to half the size
obviously because the screen

1234
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
obviously because the screen
 

1235
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,430
obviously because the screen
becomes effectively twice as big and you

1236
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
becomes effectively twice as big and you
 

1237
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,990
becomes effectively twice as big and you
can

1238
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
can
 

1239
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,510
can
display regular desktop

1240
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
display regular desktop
 

1241
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,510
display regular desktop
programs and you can run regular desktop

1242
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
programs and you can run regular desktop
 

1243
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,710
programs and you can run regular desktop
programs like evolution for instance

1244
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
programs like evolution for instance
 

1245
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,269
programs like evolution for instance
on that dinky little screen it's quite

1246
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
on that dinky little screen it's quite
 

1247
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,710
on that dinky little screen it's quite
surprising

1248
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
surprising
 

1249
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,269
surprising
you can't do it while it's at 200

1250
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
you can't do it while it's at 200
 

1251
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,630
you can't do it while it's at 200
because it's just

1252
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
because it's just
 

1253
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,630
because it's just
that just not enough real estate on the

1254
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
that just not enough real estate on the
 

1255
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,470
that just not enough real estate on the
screen so

1256
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
screen so
 

1257
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,310
screen so
none of the youtube videos that i've

1258
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
none of the youtube videos that i've
 

1259
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,510
none of the youtube videos that i've
seen show that

1260
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
seen show that
 

1261
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,590
seen show that
show that setting being used i don't

1262
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
show that setting being used i don't
 

1263
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,750
show that setting being used i don't
know why you have to have really small

1264
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
know why you have to have really small
 

1265
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,110
know why you have to have really small
fingers though when you

1266
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,120
fingers though when you
 

1267
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,630
fingers though when you
do that because the buttons are really

1268
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
do that because the buttons are really
 

1269
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,029
do that because the buttons are really
small and you have to be very precise

1270
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
small and you have to be very precise
 

1271
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,110
small and you have to be very precise
about where you push those buttons

1272
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
about where you push those buttons
 

1273
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,789
about where you push those buttons
so all right so that's why

1274
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
so all right so that's why
 

1275
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,190
so all right so that's why
i'm going to come in there now i've got

1276
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
i'm going to come in there now i've got
 

1277
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,789
i'm going to come in there now i've got
one of those i've got to find it i don't

1278
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
one of those i've got to find it i don't
 

1279
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,789
one of those i've got to find it i don't
know where it is

1280
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799

 

1281
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,830

okay what's that got a combo that's why

1282
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
okay what's that got a combo that's why
 

1283
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,669
okay what's that got a combo that's why
i use a cotton bud
