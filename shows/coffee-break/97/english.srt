github and see how they've done that

812
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
github and see how they've done that
 

813
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,430
github and see how they've done that
yeah i tend to like

814
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
yeah i tend to like
 

815
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,829
yeah i tend to like
finding projects that haven't been

816
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
finding projects that haven't been
 

817
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,110
finding projects that haven't been
solved before

818
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
solved before
 

819
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,550
solved before
um when i when i go looking i mean

820
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
um when i when i go looking i mean
 

821
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,749
um when i when i go looking i mean
i'm not going to reinvent the wheel

822
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
i'm not going to reinvent the wheel
 

823
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,990
i'm not going to reinvent the wheel
but it's a good but yeah if you're

824
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
but it's a good but yeah if you're
 

825
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,749
but it's a good but yeah if you're
looking for a niche to scratch then yeah

826
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
looking for a niche to scratch then yeah
 

827
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,509
looking for a niche to scratch then yeah
that's a good good place to start for

828
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
that's a good good place to start for
 

829
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:43,910
that's a good good place to start for
sure

830
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
sure
 

831
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,910
sure
so it's a tournament right now it's a

832
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
so it's a tournament right now it's a
 

833
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,509
so it's a tournament right now it's a
console application no it's a

834
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
console application no it's a
 

835
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,430
console application no it's a
it's an ad oh where were you talking to

836
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
it's an ad oh where were you talking to
 

837
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,030
it's an ad oh where were you talking to
me or i don't know

838
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
me or i don't know
 

839
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,430
me or i don't know
the linux ver the task warrior yes is

840
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
the linux ver the task warrior yes is
 

841
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,550
the linux ver the task warrior yes is
console but

842
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
console but
 

843
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,189
console but
um there is a version for android that

844
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
um there is a version for android that
 

845
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,150
um there is a version for android that
um

846
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
um
 

847
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,389
um
uh that overlays the

848
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
uh that overlays the
 

849
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,910
uh that overlays the
command line version with um a ui

850
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
command line version with um a ui
 

851
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,069
command line version with um a ui
which is how you drive it in under

852
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
which is how you drive it in under
 

853
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,030
which is how you drive it in under
android but

854
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
android but
 

855
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,629
android but
under the covers it's still running the

856
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
under the covers it's still running the
 

857
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,550
under the covers it's still running the
command-line version so it works really

858
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
command-line version so it works really
 

859
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,150
command-line version so it works really
well

860
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
well
 

861
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,590
well
yeah all right peter it's your turn now

862
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
yeah all right peter it's your turn now
 

863
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,670
yeah all right peter it's your turn now
i'll let you talk now what's going on

864
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
i'll let you talk now what's going on
 

865
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,790
i'll let you talk now what's going on
with you sir

866
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
with you sir

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,310
with you sir
i am i just i discovered

868
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
i am i just i discovered
 

869
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,350
i am i just i discovered
uh with that board from uh andrew

870
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
uh with that board from uh andrew
 

871
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,749
uh with that board from uh andrew
uh from android um that

872
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
uh from android um that
 

873
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,829
uh from android um that
what was wrong with it i bought that

874
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
what was wrong with it i bought that
 

875
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,790
what was wrong with it i bought that
from android

876
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
from android
 

877
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,949
from android
what is that board what does it do it's

878
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
what is that board what does it do it's
 

879
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,389
what is that board what does it do it's
a synthesizer

880
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
a synthesizer
 

881
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,230
a synthesizer
rf synthesizer and i discovered

882
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
rf synthesizer and i discovered
 

883
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,829
rf synthesizer and i discovered
that uh the thing worked but

884
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
that uh the thing worked but
 

885
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,870
that uh the thing worked but
there was the output was terrible the

886
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
there was the output was terrible the
 

887
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,710
there was the output was terrible the
upward wasn't even some way

888
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
upward wasn't even some way
 

889
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,069
upward wasn't even some way
it was awful so i had to

890
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
it was awful so i had to
 

891
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,110
it was awful so i had to
like you i wouldn't uh i would have been

892
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
like you i wouldn't uh i would have been
 

893
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,150
like you i wouldn't uh i would have been
money back

894
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
money back
 

895
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,990
money back
and they keep coming in and keep bloody

896
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
and they keep coming in and keep bloody
 

897
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,549
and they keep coming in and keep bloody
arm in an hour and then and uh

898
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
arm in an hour and then and uh
 

899
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,990
arm in an hour and then and uh
and i'll see those questions you have

900
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
and i'll see those questions you have
 

901
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,390
and i'll see those questions you have
pictures about it it's posted

902
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
pictures about it it's posted
 

903
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,069
pictures about it it's posted
yeah i'm not saying you pictured his

904
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
yeah i'm not saying you pictured his
 

905
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,510
yeah i'm not saying you pictured his
busted the thing

906
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
busted the thing
 

907
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,590
busted the thing
does that bloody work i i've been in

908
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
does that bloody work i i've been in
 

909
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,510
does that bloody work i i've been in
jail for 30 40 years

910
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
jail for 30 40 years
 

911
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,069
jail for 30 40 years
the thing is broken do you understand uh

912
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
the thing is broken do you understand uh
 

913
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,309
the thing is broken do you understand uh
and uh

914
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
and uh
 

915
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,309
and uh
but if if i went further back on the

916
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
but if if i went further back on the
 

917
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,429
but if if i went further back on the
circuit on

918
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
circuit on
 

919
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,630
circuit on
this apple transistor would knock it uh

920
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
this apple transistor would knock it uh
 

921
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,430
this apple transistor would knock it uh
i'd go back i'd say why the reason was

922
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
i'd go back i'd say why the reason was
 

923
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,750
i'd go back i'd say why the reason was
and

924
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
and
 

925
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,510
and
if you go back to the trade the price of

926
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
if you go back to the trade the price of
 

927
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,190
if you go back to the trade the price of
the transit and the big inputs of

928
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
the transit and the big inputs of
 

929
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,470
the transit and the big inputs of
transit that

930
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
transit that
 

931
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,590
transit that
there was a good waveform out of it so

932
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
there was a good waveform out of it so
 

933
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,630
there was a good waveform out of it so
my friend of mine decided yesterday on

934
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
my friend of mine decided yesterday on
 

935
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,470
my friend of mine decided yesterday on
day four yesterday to take the

936
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
day four yesterday to take the
 

937
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,669
day four yesterday to take the
transistor throughout

938
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
transistor throughout
 

939
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,110
transistor throughout
the surface man horrible yeah

940
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
the surface man horrible yeah
 

941
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,990
the surface man horrible yeah
bloody bloody horrible that's getting

942
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
bloody bloody horrible that's getting
 

943
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,830
bloody bloody horrible that's getting
used by french but uh

944
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
used by french but uh
 

945
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,470
used by french but uh
anyway we took it out but i i actually

946
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
anyway we took it out but i i actually
 

947
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,990
anyway we took it out but i i actually
had some you know what i did

948
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
had some you know what i did
 

949
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,110
had some you know what i did
yet last time and those big wheel of

950
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
yet last time and those big wheel of
 

951
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,110
yet last time and those big wheel of
transit is in our little backyard now

952
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
transit is in our little backyard now
 

953
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,230
transit is in our little backyard now
peter is that

954
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
peter is that
 

955
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,590
peter is that
is that the thing that you were trying

956

is that the thing that you were trying
 

957
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,270
is that the thing that you were trying
to use to soften the uh

958
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
to use to soften the uh
 

959
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,430
to use to soften the uh
the harshness of your of your voice is

960
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
the harshness of your of your voice is
 

961
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,470
the harshness of your of your voice is
that what it was

962
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
that what it was
 

963
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,990
that what it was
no this is a project that a friend of

991
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,870
biased on it wow so i took it out
and this time i connect the capacitor

992
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
and this time i connect the capacitor
 

993
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,789
and this time i connect the capacitor
from the input to the output

994
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
from the input to the output
 

995
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,310
from the input to the output
to the socket and money like that and

996
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
to the socket and money like that and
 

997
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,990
to the socket and money like that and
then i went to explain them yesterday

998
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
then i went to explain them yesterday
 

999
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,350
then i went to explain them yesterday
uh the guy i i will put into a box and

1000
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
uh the guy i i will put into a box and
 

1001
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,990
uh the guy i i will put into a box and
i i will put an external amplifier on

1002
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
i i will put an external amplifier on
 

1003
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,590
i i will put an external amplifier on
onto the output so i could put the

1004
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
onto the output so i could put the
 

1005
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,110
onto the output so i could put the
output up by

1006
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
output up by
 

1007
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,830
output up by
i got 10 db so he can have at least

1008
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
i got 10 db so he can have at least
 

1009
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,630
i got 10 db so he can have at least
about volt

1010
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
about volt
 

1011
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,470
about volt
output but uh they give me 50 percent

1012
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
output but uh they give me 50 percent
 

1013
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,029
output but uh they give me 50 percent
off

1014
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
off
 

1015
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,909

my plan is to take this this ssd that i

1258
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
my plan is to take this this ssd that i
 

1259
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,830
my plan is to take this this ssd that i
plan to put in the laptop

1260
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
plan to put in the laptop
 

1261
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,110
plan to put in the laptop
and i think what i'll do is put it in

1262
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
and i think what i'll do is put it in
 

1263
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,190
and i think what i'll do is put it in
the main machine because uh

1264
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
the main machine because uh
 

1265
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,669
the main machine because uh
in the main desktop machine because um

1266
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
in the main desktop machine because um
 

1267
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,430
in the main desktop machine because um
the hard drives are um

1268
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
the hard drives are um
 

1269
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,750
the hard drives are um
are a little slow for boot up so i think

1270
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
are a little slow for boot up so i think
 

1271
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,750
are a little slow for boot up so i think
that i'll probably be able to do that

1272
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
that i'll probably be able to do that
 

1273
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,830
that i'll probably be able to do that
fairly easily so that's going to be

1274
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
fairly easily so that's going to be
 

1275
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,909
fairly easily so that's going to be
yeah that is what i did to my

1276
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
yeah that is what i did to my
 

1277
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,350
yeah that is what i did to my
main system uh last summer i bought two

1279
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,830
main system uh last summer i bought two
new computers i told this in an earlier

1280
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840
new computers i told this in an earlier
 

1281
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,870

1288
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
systems which turned out to be
 

1289
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,710
