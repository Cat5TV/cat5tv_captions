00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
it cannot even see the sata drive
 

807
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,949
it cannot even see the sata drive
but as i was saying earlier the sata

808
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
but as i was saying earlier the sata
 

809
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,949
but as i was saying earlier the sata
drive does spin up

810
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
drive does spin up
 

811
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,509
drive does spin up
so i can hear it spinning up inside the

812
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
so i can hear it spinning up inside the
 

813
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,790
so i can hear it spinning up inside the
case

814
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
case
 

815
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,550
case

i deliberately put the old spinning
 

817
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,269
i deliberately put the old spinning
drive back in just a second

818
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
drive back in just a second
 

819
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,110

peter for sure
yep so and that's what i was trying to

828
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
yep so and that's what i was trying to
 

829
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,949
yep so and that's what i was trying to
tell the support folks

830
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
tell the support folks
 

831
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,870

but uh they wouldn't they wouldn't hear
 

833
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,549
but uh they wouldn't they wouldn't hear
of that you know because it falls off

834
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
of that you know because it falls off
 

835
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,710
of that you know because it falls off
it falls outside the script as soon as

836
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
it falls outside the script as soon as
 

837
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,990
it falls outside the script as soon as
something doesn't work

838
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
something doesn't work
 

839
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,470
something doesn't work
and and they run off screens and all

840
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
and and they run off screens and all
 

841
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,470
and and they run off screens and all
they can do then is say well go

842
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
they can do then is say well go
 

843
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,630
they can do then is say well go
you'll have to send it in to let us fix

844
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
you'll have to send it in to let us fix
 

845
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,829
you'll have to send it in to let us fix
it have you tried

846
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
it have you tried
 

847
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,150
it have you tried
uh have you tried uh using a live

848
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
uh have you tried uh using a live
 

849
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,069
uh have you tried uh using a live
dish or a different distro to see if

850
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
dish or a different distro to see if
 

851
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,110
dish or a different distro to see if
that would recognize it on a live disc

852
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
that would recognize it on a live disc
 

853
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,470
that would recognize it on a live disc
well that would mean booting it off a

854
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
well that would mean booting it off a
 

855
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,309
well that would mean booting it off a
usb port or something that's the only

856
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
usb port or something that's the only
 

857
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,669
usb port or something that's the only
thing that's a different path

858
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
thing that's a different path
 

859
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,990
thing that's a different path
right what i'm trying to do is to prove

860
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
right what i'm trying to do is to prove
 

861
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,750
right what i'm trying to do is to prove
that the sata connection inside the

862
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
that the sata connection inside the
 

863
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,310
that the sata connection inside the
machine

864
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
machine
 

865
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,350
machine
works

866
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360

 

867
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,710

sorry i don't think that will work

868
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
sorry i don't think that will work
 

869
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,390
sorry i don't think that will work
because i think the bios has got to

870
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
because i think the bios has got to
 

871
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,390
because i think the bios has got to
recognize it before anything else

872
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
recognize it before anything else
 

873
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,310
recognize it before anything else
that's exactly my thought as well that's

874
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
that's exactly my thought as well that's
 

875
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,830
that's exactly my thought as well that's
exactly my

876
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840

 

877
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,190

even if i could get it to boot off the

878
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
even if i could get it to boot off the
 

879
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,350
even if i could get it to boot off the
usb if the bios doesn't recognize that

880
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
usb if the bios doesn't recognize that
 

881
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,789
usb if the bios doesn't recognize that
spinning drive

882
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
spinning drive
 

883
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,870

i'm thinking of getting an xu4 maybe
that would work better

1060
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
that would work better
 

1061

right now
 

1079
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,149
right now
so i'm really glad that i got mine when

1080
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
so i'm really glad that i got mine when
 

1081
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,350
so i'm really glad that i got mine when
i when i did so

1082
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
i when i did so
 

1083
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,110
i when i did so
i could get a chromebook and try putting

1084
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
i could get a chromebook and try putting
 

1085
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,789
i could get a chromebook and try putting
ubuntu or something on that

1086
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
ubuntu or something on that
 

1087
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,310
ubuntu or something on that
yeah you could i don't know what the

1088
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
yeah you could i don't know what the
 

1089
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,549
yeah you could i don't know what the
hardware is like we'll see

1090
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
hardware is like we'll see
 

1091
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,549
hardware is like we'll see
see how that works out for you a lot of

1092
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
see how that works out for you a lot of
 

1093
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,149
see how that works out for you a lot of
them have emmcs

1094
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
them have emmcs
 

1095
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,110
them have emmcs
so that could truly be that could be a

1096
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
so that could truly be that could be a
 

1097
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,470
so that could truly be that could be a
challenge

1098
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
challenge
 

1099
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,470
challenge
this has an emmc in there as well and it

1100
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
this has an emmc in there as well and it
 

1101
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,950
this has an emmc in there as well and it
has room to put a uh an 80 millimeter

1102
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
has room to put a uh an 80 millimeter
 

1103
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,470
has room to put a uh an 80 millimeter
emmc in it so a larger physical size

1104
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
emmc in it so a larger physical size
 

1105
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,470
emmc in it so a larger physical size
which hopefully would translate to a

1106
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
which hopefully would translate to a
 

1107
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,750
which hopefully would translate to a
larger memory

1108
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
larger memory
 

1109
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,029
larger memory
size or storage size yeah i'd like to

1110
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
size or storage size yeah i'd like to
 

1111
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,110
size or storage size yeah i'd like to
i'd like to do that just to see what uh

1112
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,120
i'd like to do that just to see what uh
 

1113
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,149
i'd like to do that just to see what uh
just to see what happens so maybe i

1114
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
just to see what happens so maybe i
 

1115
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,430
just to see what happens so maybe i
could just

1116
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
could just
 

1117
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,990
could just
dd the windows 10 partitions across and

1118
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
dd the windows 10 partitions across and
 

1119
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,909
dd the windows 10 partitions across and
then

1120
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
then
 

1121
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,110
then
make a deal boot into linux that way so

1122
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
make a deal boot into linux that way so
 

1123
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,430
make a deal boot into linux that way so
there's all kinds of sneaky ways to do

1124
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
there's all kinds of sneaky ways to do
 

1125
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,230
there's all kinds of sneaky ways to do
this

1126
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
this
 

1127
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,549

something but
 

1275
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,630
something but
it's probably going back to amazon

1276
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
it's probably going back to amazon
 

1277
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,710

it worked up to the up to the
 

1281
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,750
it worked up to the up to the
synthesizer but

1282
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
synthesizer but
 

1283
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,390
synthesizer but
uh for some reason the amplifier chip

1284
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,400
uh for some reason the amplifier chip
 

1285
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,669
uh for some reason the amplifier chip
decided to

1286
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
decided to
 

1287
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,390

1291
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,990

anybody knows anything about uh i

1292
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
anybody knows anything about uh i
 

1293
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,870
anybody knows anything about uh i
squared c

1294
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
squared c
 

1295
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,390
squared c
i squared c uh interfaces

1296
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
i squared c uh interfaces
 

1297
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,870
i squared c uh interfaces
yeah it is a an on the wire protocol

1298
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
yeah it is a an on the wire protocol
 

1299

00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
um it's a serial protocol
 

1303
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,510
um it's a serial protocol
yeah in our beauty university but a long

1304
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
yeah in our beauty university but a long
 

1305
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,549
yeah in our beauty university but a long
time ago

1306
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
time ago
 

1307
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,110
time ago
um i want to use it to connect to a

1308
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
um i want to use it to connect to a
 

1309
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,230
um i want to use it to connect to a
piece of

1310
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
piece of
 

1311
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,149
piece of
board and uh it's using linux or on the

1312
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
board and uh it's using linux or on the
 

1313
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:10,549
board and uh it's using linux or on the
pie

1314
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
pie
 

1315
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,750
pie
anybody got any ideas yeah i don't know

1316
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
anybody got any ideas yeah i don't know
 

1317
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,669
anybody got any ideas yeah i don't know
i don't know that much about it i've

1318
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:15,679
i don't know that much about it i've
 

1319
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,750
i don't know that much about it i've
i've used it on an arduino

1320
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
i've used it on an arduino
 

1321
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,029
i've used it on an arduino
before where i've um where i've just

1322
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:21,039
before where i've um where i've just
 

1323
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,070
before where i've um where i've just
been messing with with the arduino to

1324
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
been messing with with the arduino to
 

1325
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,950
been messing with with the arduino to
um to try and get it to talk to other

1326
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
um to try and get it to talk to other
 

1327
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,990
um to try and get it to talk to other
units but

1328
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
units but
 

1329
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,830
units but
i've used pre-built libraries i've never

1330
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
i've used pre-built libraries i've never
 

1331
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,430
i've used pre-built libraries i've never
never written anything from scratch yeah

1332
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
never written anything from scratch yeah
 

1333
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,070
never written anything from scratch yeah
yeah yeah

1334
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
yeah yeah
 

1335
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,350
yeah yeah
that that's what i'm looking for the

1336
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
that that's what i'm looking for the
 

1337
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,110
that that's what i'm looking for the
libraries particularly

1338
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
libraries particularly
 

1339
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,789
libraries particularly
and uh i would i would check um

1340
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:38,799
and uh i would i would check um
 

1341
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,789
and uh i would i would check um
adafruit adafruit is a company in new

york that um
 

1345
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,470
york that um
that gives libraries away for free to

1346
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
that gives libraries away for free to
 

1347
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,669
that gives libraries away for free to
drive a lot of the

1348
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
drive a lot of the
 

1349
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,390
drive a lot of the
peripherals that work with arduinos so

1350
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
peripherals that work with arduinos so
 

1351
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,710
peripherals that work with arduinos so
that might be uh

1352
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
that might be uh
 

1353
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,870
that might be uh
that was mentioned to me the other day

1354
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
that was mentioned to me the other day
 

1355
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,350
that was mentioned to me the other day
uh like a fruitcat though

1356
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
uh like a fruitcat though
 

1357
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,230
uh like a fruitcat though
um but the the ones that we used were a

1358
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
um but the the ones that we used were a
 

1359
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,029
um but the the ones that we used were a
long time ago

1360
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
long time ago
 

1361
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,630
long time ago
20 years ago or something uh and

1362
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
20 years ago or something uh and
 

1363
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,710
20 years ago or something uh and
i remember you have to give each device

1364
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
i remember you have to give each device
 

1365
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,750
i remember you have to give each device
a address

1366
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
a address
 

1367
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,269
a address
you know things to tell it which one to

1368
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
you know things to tell it which one to
 

1369
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,149
you know things to tell it which one to
wake up and

1370
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
wake up and
 

1371
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,870
wake up and
right right talk to that question yeah

1372
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
right right talk to that question yeah
 

1373
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,350
right right talk to that question yeah
yeah

1374
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
yeah
 

1375

yeah
and already that's about as much as i

1376
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
and already that's about as much as i
 

1377
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,110
and already that's about as much as i
know i don't know much more than that

1378
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
know i don't know much more than that
 

1379
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,029
know i don't know much more than that
peter i'm sorry about that but

1380
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
peter i'm sorry about that but
 

1381
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,590
peter i'm sorry about that but
that's that's about as much as i can as

1382
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
that's that's about as much as i can as
 

1383

okay okay i've done a lot of looking

1386
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
okay okay i've done a lot of looking
 

1387
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,310
okay okay i've done a lot of looking
through it sometimes but

1388
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
through it sometimes but
 

1389
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,549
through it sometimes but
you know the libraries are the libraries

1390
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:30,559
you know the libraries are the libraries
 

1391
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,909
you know the libraries are the libraries
are written in c and c

1392
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
are written in c and c
 

1393
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,430
are written in c and c
plus plus so uh i know you like pascal

1394
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
plus plus so uh i know you like pascal
 

1395
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,830
plus plus so uh i know you like pascal
so you're probably what they were they

1396
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
so you're probably what they were they
 

1397
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,669
so you're probably what they were they
do at pisco library they seemed

1398
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
do at pisco library they seemed
 

1399
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,789
do at pisco library they seemed
as well which was uh on youtube yeah i

1400
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
as well which was uh on youtube yeah i
 

1401
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,110
as well which was uh on youtube yeah i
don't know that there's any pascal

1402
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
don't know that there's any pascal
 

1403
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,710
don't know that there's any pascal
maybe there is i've it's been a while

1404
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
maybe there is i've it's been a while
 

1405
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,470
maybe there is i've it's been a while
since i've looked at it there there

1406
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
since i've looked at it there there
 

1407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,310
since i've looked at it there there
might be some pascal stuff but

1408
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
might be some pascal stuff but
 

1409
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,149
might be some pascal stuff but
i don't know i've done so i've done see

1410
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
i don't know i've done so i've done see
 

1411
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,110
i don't know i've done so i've done see
but a long time ago

1412
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
but a long time ago
 

1413
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,190
but a long time ago
i don't mind doing that going i was

1414
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
i don't mind doing that going i was
 

1415
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,470
i don't mind doing that going i was
pretty good but

1416

pretty good but
 

1417
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,070
pretty good but
i've done it for a long time you know i

i've done it for a long time you know i
 

1419
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,590
i've done it for a long time you know i
forgot most of

1420
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:01,600
forgot most of
