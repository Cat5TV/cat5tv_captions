and a few others on yeah
 

167
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,710
and a few others on yeah
um and that was basically it um yeah you

168
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
um and that was basically it um yeah you
 

169
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,670
um and that was basically it um yeah you
needed to have a

170
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
needed to have a
 

171
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,550
needed to have a
uh an account on the system running the

172
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
uh an account on the system running the
 

173
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,430
uh an account on the system running the
mail server

174
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
mail server
 

175
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,830
mail server
which i have and then that's all there

176
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
which i have and then that's all there
 

177
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,350
which i have and then that's all there
is to it

178
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
is to it
 

179
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,229
is to it
so the the server must be contactable

180
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
so the the server must be contactable
 

181
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,990
so the the server must be contactable
from outside your network right

182
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
from outside your network right
 

183
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,229
from outside your network right
so yeah so the incoming port 25

184
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
so yeah so the incoming port 25
 

185
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,270
so yeah so the incoming port 25
need to be open and these days also um

186
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
need to be open and these days also um
 

187
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,229
need to be open and these days also um
two other ports let me check that

188
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
two other ports let me check that
 

189
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,430
two other ports let me check that
i don't remember it in my head

190
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
i don't remember it in my head
 

191
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,830
i don't remember it in my head
so i'm portraying my gateway to find the

192
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
so i'm portraying my gateway to find the
 

193
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,869
so i'm portraying my gateway to find the
uh

194
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
uh
 

195
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,070
uh
oh okay so presumably you set your

196
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
oh okay so presumably you set your
 

197
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,470
oh okay so presumably you set your
uh internet modem to bridging mode to to

198
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
uh internet modem to bridging mode to to
 

199
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,910
uh internet modem to bridging mode to to
allow you to

200
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
allow you to
 

201
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,949
allow you to
uh to do the nat um

202
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
uh to do the nat um
 

203
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,110
uh to do the nat um
the network address translation or to

204
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
the network address translation or to
 

205
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,990
the network address translation or to
port forward

206
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
port forward
 

207
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,270
port forward
that that port in from outside is that

208
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
that that port in from outside is that
 

209
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,830
that that port in from outside is that
true

210
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
true
 

211
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,949
true
yeah and there's two ways to do that one

212
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
yeah and there's two ways to do that one
 

213
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,750
yeah and there's two ways to do that one
is to have the

214
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
is to have the
 

215
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,990
is to have the
modem in a bridge which i do because i

216
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
modem in a bridge which i do because i
 

217
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,030
modem in a bridge which i do because i
need the

218
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
need the
 

219
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,150
need the
actual uh local system to have uh

220
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
actual uh local system to have uh
 

221
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,150
actual uh local system to have uh
the public uh public ip

222
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
the public uh public ip
 

223
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,790
the public uh public ip
and that system is doing all the writing

224
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
and that system is doing all the writing
 

225
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,909
and that system is doing all the writing
and then

226
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
and then
 

227
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,510
and then
that translation and so on okay um

228
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
that translation and so on okay um
 

229
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,030
that translation and so on okay um
what um 995 yeah

230
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
what um 995 yeah
 

231
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,070
what um 995 yeah
no um oh is that the ssl

232
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
no um oh is that the ssl
 

233
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,550
no um oh is that the ssl
port for mail

234
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560

 

235
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,469

i'm not sure i have that open

236
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479

 

237
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,830

yeah but there are three ports

238
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
yeah but there are three ports
 

239
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,110
yeah but there are three ports
um 425 and there's two other parts

240
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
um 425 and there's two other parts
 

241
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,230
um 425 and there's two other parts
um that is uh one is the smtps port and

242
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
um that is uh one is the smtps port and
 

243
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,070
um that is uh one is the smtps port and
one is the um

244
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
one is the um
 

245
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,870
one is the um
uh authentication port uh which is those

246
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
uh authentication port uh which is those
 

247
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,909
uh authentication port uh which is those
uh

248
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
uh
 

249
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,230
uh
to put our ssl

250
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240

 

251
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,590

encrypted so um um

252
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
encrypted so um um
 

253
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,590
encrypted so um um
if under the

255
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,150

is used if you have an outside clients

256
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
is used if you have an outside clients
 

257
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,230
is used if you have an outside clients
like if you have a mobile phone or a

email via your router which is at home
when you're not that you would need for

274
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
when you're not that you would need for
 

275
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,110
when you're not that you would need for
that you would use an imac connection

that you would use an imac connection
 

277
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,990
that you would use an imac connection
right you would

278
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
right you would
 

279
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,590
right you would
you wouldn't no you can use a pop you

you wouldn't no you can use a pop you
 

281
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,830
you wouldn't no you can use a pop you
can use the um

282
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
can use the um
 

283
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,749
can use the um
the same type of authentication as if

284
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
the same type of authentication as if
 

285
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,390
the same type of authentication as if
you're using uh gml or outlook but

286
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
you're using uh gml or outlook but
 

287
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,390
you're using uh gml or outlook but
you're not using imap oh okay okay

288
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
you're not using imap oh okay okay
 

289
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,430
you're not using imap oh okay okay
so um um okay

290
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
so um um okay
 

291
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,830
so um um okay
so but did the only thing then in that

292
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
so but did the only thing then in that
 

293
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,510
so but did the only thing then in that
case you'd want to leave the mail on the

294
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
case you'd want to leave the mail on the
 

295
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,189
case you'd want to leave the mail on the
server so that your main machine can

296
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
server so that your main machine can
 

297
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,110
server so that your main machine can
retrieve that email for you

298
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
retrieve that email for you
 

299
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,309
retrieve that email for you
for you yeah that is a setting

300
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319

 

301
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,350

i'm a client yeah okay and if you're

302
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
i'm a client yeah okay and if you're
 

303
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,670
i'm a client yeah okay and if you're
using a pop fee to check your email then

304
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
using a pop fee to check your email then
 

305
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,790
using a pop fee to check your email then
yeah you need to

306
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
yeah you need to
 

307
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,870
yeah you need to
actively enable leaving the mail on the

308
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
actively enable leaving the mail on the
 

309
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,830
actively enable leaving the mail on the
server because the deal

310
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
server because the deal
 

311
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,629
server because the deal
is fetch the mail and delete it yes yes

312
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
is fetch the mail and delete it yes yes
 

313
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,350
is fetch the mail and delete it yes yes
yes

314
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
yes
 

315
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,350
yes
so yeah let's do that

316
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360

 

317
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,990

one or two of the steps that one need to

318
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
one or two of the steps that one need to
 

319
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,390
one or two of the steps that one need to
take

320
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
take
 

321
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,710
take
in order to get in the mail into the

322
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
in order to get in the mail into the
 

323
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,830
in order to get in the mail into the
server

324
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
server
 

325
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,909
server
uh your mx records mail exchange records

326
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
uh your mx records mail exchange records
 

327
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,870
uh your mx records mail exchange records
um dns records need to be pointed to

328
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
um dns records need to be pointed to
 

329
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,590
um dns records need to be pointed to
your local um

330
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
your local um
 

331
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,710
your local um

dropping all the time
 

391
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,869
dropping all the time
um especially on an incoming phone call

392
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
um especially on an incoming phone call
 

393
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,350
um especially on an incoming phone call
the problem was that my dsl is coming in

394
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
the problem was that my dsl is coming in
 

395
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,710
the problem was that my dsl is coming in
on the same line

396
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
on the same line
 

397
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,710
on the same line
as the parts the plain old telephone

398
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
as the parts the plain old telephone
 

399
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,909
as the parts the plain old telephone
connection

400
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
connection
 

401
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,749
connection
and so every time an incoming phone call

402
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
and so every time an incoming phone call
 

403
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,110
and so every time an incoming phone call
my internet would drop

404
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
my internet would drop
 

405
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,589
my internet would drop

actually
 

409
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,710
actually
this is uh this is a newer dsl that does

410
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
this is uh this is a newer dsl that does
 

411
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,110
this is uh this is a newer dsl that does
not require the filters peter

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
authentication mechanism towards the
 

495
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,870
authentication mechanism towards the
server that is there um

496
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
server that is there um
 

497
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,190
server that is there um
most dsl connections have some sort of

498
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
most dsl connections have some sort of
 

499
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,150
most dsl connections have some sort of
um

500
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
um
 

501
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,829
um
username and password you don't know

502
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
username and password you don't know
 

503
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,590
username and password you don't know
about it to get up the line

504
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
about it to get up the line
 

505
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,470
about it to get up the line
so the way this you go ahead peter i

506
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
so the way this you go ahead peter i
 

507
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,590
so the way this you go ahead peter i
don't understand

508
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
don't understand
 

509
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,150
don't understand
why don't you ever feel to be uh

510
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
why don't you ever feel to be uh
 

511
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,870
why don't you ever feel to be uh
basically

512
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
basically
 

513
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,150
basically
audio is between norton 3k and the

514
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
audio is between norton 3k and the
 

515
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,590
audio is between norton 3k and the
uh internet is up about one mag and the

516
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
uh internet is up about one mag and the
 

517
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,829
uh internet is up about one mag and the
filter to basically removes one from the

518
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
filter to basically removes one from the
 

519
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,269
filter to basically removes one from the
other basically

520
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
other basically
 

521
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,030
other basically
and the reason why peter is because um

522
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
and the reason why peter is because um
 

523
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,069
and the reason why peter is because um
what the what the telecom tech did is

524
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
what the what the telecom tech did is
 

525
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,550
what the what the telecom tech did is
actually

526
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
actually
 

527
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,470
actually
install the splitter at the very head of

528
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
install the splitter at the very head of
 

529
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,150
install the splitter at the very head of
the line at the very

530
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
the line at the very
 

531
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,310
the line at the very
at the very top of the line that

532
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
at the very top of the line that
 

533
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,910
at the very top of the line that
separates out the

534
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
separates out the
 

535
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,269
separates out the
pots line and the dsl line

536
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
pots line and the dsl line
 

537
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,230
pots line and the dsl line
okay i'm down there yeah okay but even

538
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
okay i'm down there yeah okay but even
 

539
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,030
okay i'm down there yeah okay but even
even

540
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
even
 

541
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,310
even
so um even even with that

542
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
so um even even with that
 

543
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,150
so um even even with that
hardware in place uh the

544
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
hardware in place uh the
 

545
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,150
hardware in place uh the
as long as my dsl was on the same line

546
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
as long as my dsl was on the same line
 

547
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,110
as long as my dsl was on the same line
as my

548
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
as my
 

549
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,230
as my
uh as my plain old telephone line it

550
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
uh as my plain old telephone line it
 

551
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,069
uh as my plain old telephone line it
would uh it would keep dropping

552
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
would uh it would keep dropping
 

553
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,990
would uh it would keep dropping
the connection so what the telecom tech

554
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
the connection so what the telecom tech
 

555
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,269
the connection so what the telecom tech
did is separated them out because i have

556
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
did is separated them out because i have
 

557
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,630
did is separated them out because i have
i have four pair of uh of um

558
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
i have four pair of uh of um
 

559
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,590
i have four pair of uh of um
of lines running to my house and only

560
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
of lines running to my house and only
 

561
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,590
of lines running to my house and only
one was in use that had the dsl and the

562
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
one was in use that had the dsl and the
 

563
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,790
one was in use that had the dsl and the
pots on it right

564
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
pots on it right
 

565
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,190
pots on it right
so what he did is he separated out the

566
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
so what he did is he separated out the
 

567
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,829
so what he did is he separated out the
dsl

568
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
dsl
 

569
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,389
dsl
into a separate pair left the pots on

570
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
into a separate pair left the pots on
 

571
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,269
into a separate pair left the pots on
one line

572
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
one line
 

573
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,430
one line
i got my dsl on a different pair and now

574
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
i got my dsl on a different pair and now
 

575
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,269
i got my dsl on a different pair and now
now it's been soldered as a rock touch

576
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
now it's been soldered as a rock touch
 

577
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,590
now it's been soldered as a rock touch
wood you watch you've come apart now you

578
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
wood you watch you've come apart now you
 

579
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,000
wood you watch you've come apart now you
watch

580
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,010
watch
 

581
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,389
watch
[Laughter]

582
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399

 

583
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,110

as far as bridging the modems concerned

584
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
as far as bridging the modems concerned
 

585
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,389
as far as bridging the modems concerned
um

586
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
um
 

587
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,430
um
i don't know how it is with with your um

588
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
i don't know how it is with with your um
 

589
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,550
i don't know how it is with with your um
internet modem but with mine it doesn't

590
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
internet modem but with mine it doesn't
 

591
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,670
internet modem but with mine it doesn't
look like

592
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
look like
 

593
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,350
look like
uh bridging is completely uh um

594
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
uh bridging is completely uh um
 

595
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,430
uh bridging is completely uh um
100 it doesn't look like it does it

596
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
100 it doesn't look like it does it
 

597
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,069
100 it doesn't look like it does it
how do i want to put this there's still

598
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
how do i want to put this there's still
 

599
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,030
how do i want to put this there's still
some pieces

600
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
some pieces
 

601
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,750
some pieces
active in the modem even after i bridge

602
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
active in the modem even after i bridge
 

603
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,389
active in the modem even after i bridge
it

604
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
it
 

605
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,389
it
and i think those pieces provide the

606
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
and i think those pieces provide the
 

607
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,670
and i think those pieces provide the
authentication

608
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
authentication
 

609
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,069
authentication
mechanism that you're talking about i

610
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
mechanism that you're talking about i
 

611
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,829
mechanism that you're talking about i
think they have to be there or otherwise

612
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
think they have to be there or otherwise
 

613
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,750
think they have to be there or otherwise
the whole thing just comes apart

614
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
the whole thing just comes apart
 

615
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,110
the whole thing just comes apart
so um so bridging the modem

616
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
so um so bridging the modem
 

617
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,269
so um so bridging the modem
is not a com is not complete like i've

618
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
is not a com is not complete like i've
 

619
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,790
is not a com is not complete like i've
seen uh

620
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
seen uh
 

621
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,310
seen uh
you know robbie talks about uh um

622
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
you know robbie talks about uh um
 

623
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,509
you know robbie talks about uh um
bridging the modem at the at the studio

624
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
bridging the modem at the at the studio
 

625
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,269
bridging the modem at the at the studio
and it sounds like it's a complete

626
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
and it sounds like it's a complete
 

627
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,509
and it sounds like it's a complete
bridge everything it's a fire hose

628
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
bridge everything it's a fire hose
 

629
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,870
bridge everything it's a fire hose
everything that comes in

630
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
everything that comes in
 

631
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,990
everything that comes in
hits your router right now whether he

632
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
hits your router right now whether he
 

633
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,750
hits your router right now whether he
had to set up any kind of authentication

634
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
had to set up any kind of authentication
 

635
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,470
had to set up any kind of authentication
i don't know

636
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
i don't know
 

637
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,670
i don't know
but that is not true of this modem

638
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
but that is not true of this modem
 

639
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,470
but that is not true of this modem
this modem is not a complete bridge some

640
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
this modem is not a complete bridge some
 

641
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,269
this modem is not a complete bridge some
of the

642
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
of the
 

643
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,910
of the
some of the traffic like the as you said

644
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
some of the traffic like the as you said
 

645
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,150
some of the traffic like the as you said
the authentication some of that

646
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
the authentication some of that
 

647
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,310
the authentication some of that
i think is retained by the modem and

648
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
i think is retained by the modem and
 

649
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,069
i think is retained by the modem and
keeps going like that that's

650
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
keeps going like that that's
 

651
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,750
keeps going like that that's
that's one of the things i've got to try

652
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
that's one of the things i've got to try
 

653
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,590
that's one of the things i've got to try
i want to do that sometime when i

654
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
i want to do that sometime when i
 

655
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,310
i want to do that sometime when i
when i can tolerate i don't want to do

656
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
when i can tolerate i don't want to do
 

657
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,030
when i can tolerate i don't want to do

and

714
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
and
 

715
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,310
and
laptop that that laptop is what i'm on

716
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
laptop that that laptop is what i'm on
 

717
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,550
laptop that that laptop is what i'm on
zoom with right now did you have any

718
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
zoom with right now did you have any
 

719
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,189
zoom with right now did you have any
problem with the operation

720
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
problem with the operation
 

721
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,509
problem with the operation
not really i wound up having to tear the

722
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
not really i wound up having to tear the
 

723
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,110
not really i wound up having to tear the
laptop apart

724
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
laptop apart
 

725
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,910
laptop apart
almost entirely i think the only

726
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
almost entirely i think the only
 

727
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,829
almost entirely i think the only
component i didn't remove was the ram

728
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
component i didn't remove was the ram
 

729
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,030
component i didn't remove was the ram
sticks

730
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
sticks
 

731
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,550
sticks
um yeah it was it was quite a job took

732
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
um yeah it was it was quite a job took
 

733
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,550
um yeah it was it was quite a job took
about an hour

734
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
about an hour
 

735
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,110
about an hour
like that character partnership yeah

736
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
like that character partnership yeah
 

737
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,150
like that character partnership yeah
yeah but but

738
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
yeah but but
 

739
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,710
yeah but but
uh how similar was it to robbie's

740
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
uh how similar was it to robbie's
 

741
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,389
uh how similar was it to robbie's
experience on his um

742
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
experience on his um
 

743
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,590
experience on his um
on his show i think his whole process

744
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
on his show i think his whole process
 

745
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,069
on his show i think his whole process
took about half as long as mine did

746
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
took about half as long as mine did
 

747
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,550
took about half as long as mine did
well yeah he's probably done it a few

748
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
well yeah he's probably done it a few
 

749
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,269
well yeah he's probably done it a few
times too

750
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
times too
 

751
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,790
times too
so yeah yeah and it was obvious that the

752
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
so yeah yeah and it was obvious that the
 

753
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,189
so yeah yeah and it was obvious that the
i did a youtube video to um

754
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
i did a youtube video to um
 

755
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,110
i did a youtube video to um
to know how to do this because i could

756
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
to know how to do this because i could
 

757
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,150
to know how to do this because i could
find one that was specific to my laptop

758
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
find one that was specific to my laptop
 

759
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,110
find one that was specific to my laptop
that's nice if you if i tried using

760
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
that's nice if you if i tried using
 

761
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,269
that's nice if you if i tried using
robbie's video it's not specific to my

762
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
robbie's video it's not specific to my
 

763
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,389
robbie's video it's not specific to my
laptop

764
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
laptop
 

765
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,629
laptop
there may be things i wouldn't know

766
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
there may be things i wouldn't know
 

767
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,509
there may be things i wouldn't know
about

768
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
about
 

769
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,910
about
yes now were you able to just replace

770
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
yes now were you able to just replace
 

771
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,509
yes now were you able to just replace
the fan or did you have to replace the

772
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
the fan or did you have to replace the
 

773
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,430
the fan or did you have to replace the
entire cooling mechanism that leads up

774
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
entire cooling mechanism that leads up
 

775
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,710
entire cooling mechanism that leads up
to the cpu

776
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
to the cpu
 

777
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,350
to the cpu
just the fan the cooling mechanism and

778
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
just the fan the cooling mechanism and
 

779
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,430
just the fan the cooling mechanism and
the heatsink on the bridge were separate

780
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
the heatsink on the bridge were separate
 

781
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,230
the heatsink on the bridge were separate
from the fan

782
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
from the fan
 

783
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,189
from the fan
oh nice that should have made it easier

784
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
oh nice that should have made it easier
 

785
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,269
oh nice that should have made it easier
for you i would think

786
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
for you i would think
 

787
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,670
for you i would think
yeah yeah it was a whole lot easier yeah

788
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
yeah yeah it was a whole lot easier yeah
 

789
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,389
yeah yeah it was a whole lot easier yeah
the heatsink on the cpu was

790
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
the heatsink on the cpu was
 

791
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,590
the heatsink on the cpu was
um actually a little piece of copper

792
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
um actually a little piece of copper
 

793
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,189
um actually a little piece of copper
that wound around back to the fan okay

794
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
that wound around back to the fan okay
 

795
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,470
that wound around back to the fan okay
okay i remember 20 years ago i was

and i screwed up a screw off all the

822
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
and i screwed up a screw off all the
 

823
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,670
and i screwed up a screw off all the
screws i found and that i could

824
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
screws i found and that i could
 

825
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,590
screws i found and that i could
could see it but it's one screw that i

826
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
could see it but it's one screw that i
 

827
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,710
could see it but it's one screw that i
didn't find

828
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
didn't find
 

829
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,550
didn't find
apparently because it still was attached

830
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
apparently because it still was attached
 

831
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,470
apparently because it still was attached
to something

832
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
to something
 

833
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,790
to something
and as i couldn't find it then i gave up

834
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
and as i couldn't find it then i gave up
 

835
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,150
and as i couldn't find it then i gave up
and i screwed everything back

836
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
and i screwed everything back
 

837
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,470
and i screwed everything back
and already worked i'm not surprised

838
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
and already worked i'm not surprised
 

839
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,230
and already worked i'm not surprised
i've had i've done that before

840
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
i've had i've done that before
 

841
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,150
i've had i've done that before
i have done that with with electronic

842
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
i have done that with with electronic
 

843
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,389
i have done that with with electronic
components

844
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
components
 

845
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,629
components
where i've literally just taken it apart

846
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
where i've literally just taken it apart
 

847
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,069
where i've literally just taken it apart
put it all back together

848
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
put it all back together
 

849
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,150
put it all back together
and the thing just starts working yeah

850
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
and the thing just starts working yeah
 

851
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,829
and the thing just starts working yeah
and i didn't and i didn't disconnect a

852
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
and i didn't and i didn't disconnect a
 

853
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,269
and i didn't and i didn't disconnect a
single plug

854
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
single plug
 

855
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,189
single plug
right all i did was unscrew the back and

856
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
right all i did was unscrew the back and
 

857
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,590
right all i did was unscrew the back and
then four screws and there was a

858
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
then four screws and there was a
 

859
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,350
then four screws and there was a
fifth screw inside that i didn't see it

860
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
fifth screw inside that i didn't see it
 

861
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,949
fifth screw inside that i didn't see it
that could be no but you but you

862
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
that could be no but you but you
 

863
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,230
that could be no but you but you
unscrewed also

864
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
unscrewed also
 

865
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,550
unscrewed also
the screws around the main board right

866
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
the screws around the main board right
 

867
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,990
the screws around the main board right
around the pcb right

868
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
around the pcb right
 

869
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,629
around the pcb right
now yeah yeah well that's probably what

870
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
now yeah yeah well that's probably what
 

871
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,990
now yeah yeah well that's probably what
fixed it because

872
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
fixed it because
 

873
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,590
fixed it because
it would have been tarnish or something

874
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
it would have been tarnish or something
 

875
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,189
it would have been tarnish or something
on the grounding posts

876
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
on the grounding posts
 

877
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,270
on the grounding posts
by by unscrewing them screwing them back

878
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
by by unscrewing them screwing them back
 

879
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,909
by by unscrewing them screwing them back
on again you cleaned off that tarnish

880
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
on again you cleaned off that tarnish
 

881
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,069
on again you cleaned off that tarnish
made a good grounding connection and

882
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
made a good grounding connection and
 

883
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,750
made a good grounding connection and
probably started working at that

884
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
probably started working at that
 

885
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,429
probably started working at that
now it'll probably crack out again at

886
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
now it'll probably crack out again at
 

887
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,429
now it'll probably crack out again at
some point because it

888
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439

 

889
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,429

oh good good job well done

890
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
oh good good job well done
 

891
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,029
oh good good job well done
so if we're doing nothing out of us on

892
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
so if we're doing nothing out of us on
 

893
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,990
so if we're doing nothing out of us on
an excellent job

894
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
an excellent job
 

895
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,950
an excellent job
this is this is the uh famous pine phone

896
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
this is this is the uh famous pine phone
 

897
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,990
this is this is the uh famous pine phone
it's running

898
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
it's running
 

899
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,029
it's running
now um the same distro arch linux that

900
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
now um the same distro arch linux that
 

901
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,390
now um the same distro arch linux that
i've had before

902
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
i've had before
 

903
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,669
i've had before
seems to be working great um would i use

904
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
seems to be working great um would i use
 

905
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,310
seems to be working great um would i use
it as a daily driver i'm not sure yet

906
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
it as a daily driver i'm not sure yet
 

907
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,549
it as a daily driver i'm not sure yet
because i've i've been doing some

908
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
because i've i've been doing some
 

909
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,310
because i've i've been doing some
research on this

910
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
research on this
 

911
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,190
research on this
and the usb c connector i don't know if

912
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
and the usb c connector i don't know if
 

913
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,430
and the usb c connector i don't know if
that's going to come up at all on but

914
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
that's going to come up at all on but
 

915
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,830
that's going to come up at all on but
i'm not going to yeah there it is you

916
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
i'm not going to yeah there it is you
 

917
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,750
i'm not going to yeah there it is you
can see the edge of it yeah you could

918
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
can see the edge of it yeah you could
 

919
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,029
can see the edge of it yeah you could
just see the edge of it

920
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
just see the edge of it
 

921
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,789
just see the edge of it
the usbc connector when i tried to

922
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
the usbc connector when i tried to
 

923
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,430
the usbc connector when i tried to
connect

924
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
connect
 

925
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,789
connect
a usbc to ethernet

926
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
a usbc to ethernet
 

927
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,270
a usbc to ethernet
dongle to it it would not start it would

928
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
dongle to it it would not start it would
 

929
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,110
dongle to it it would not start it would
not open up

930
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
not open up
 

931
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,789
not open up
so i'm not sure if i'm going to have any

932
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
so i'm not sure if i'm going to have any
 

933
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,230
so i'm not sure if i'm going to have any
good success

934
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
good success
 

935
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,070
good success
with this and the dongle that i've still

936
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
with this and the dongle that i've still
 

937
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,350
with this and the dongle that i've still
got coming

938
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
got coming
 

939
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,470
got coming
and still on its way so i started

940
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
and still on its way so i started
 

941
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,669
and still on its way so i started
researching on pine64 and it turns out

942
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
researching on pine64 and it turns out
 

943
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,270
researching on pine64 and it turns out
that this unit has a main board

944
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
that this unit has a main board
 

945
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,390
that this unit has a main board
on it that has components that do not

946
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
on it that has components that do not
 

947
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,470
on it that has components that do not
exactly

948
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480

 

949
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,590

implement the usbc

950
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
implement the usbc
 

951
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,230
implement the usbc
protocol even at the hardware level

952
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
protocol even at the hardware level
 

953
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,230
protocol even at the hardware level
there are some sync transistors on there

954
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
there are some sync transistors on there
 

955
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,990
there are some sync transistors on there
or something that are causing

956
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
or something that are causing
 

957
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,070
or something that are causing
uh causing some pins to not have the

958
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
uh causing some pins to not have the
 

959
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,750
uh causing some pins to not have the
correct status

960
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
correct status
 

961
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,150
correct status
so i may be replacing the main board on

962
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
so i may be replacing the main board on
 

963
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,950
so i may be replacing the main board on
this

964
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
this
 

965
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,190
this
if i can find one at pine64 they're all

966
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
if i can find one at pine64 they're all
 

967
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,350
if i can find one at pine64 they're all
out of uh they're all out of stock

968
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
out of uh they're all out of stock
 

969
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,390
out of uh they're all out of stock
um one of the one of the guys there one

970
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
um one of the one of the guys there one
 

971
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,150
um one of the one of the guys there one
of them actually the person who

972
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
of them actually the person who
 

973
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,270
of them actually the person who
um who introduced us to the pine book uh

974
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280
um who introduced us to the pine book uh
 

975
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,270
um who introduced us to the pine book uh
to the pine book and the prime time and

976
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
to the pine book and the prime time and
 

977
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,750
to the pine book and the prime time and
all that

978
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
all that
 

979
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,029
all that
and the pine phone uh versus or

980
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
and the pine phone uh versus or
 

981
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,630
and the pine phone uh versus or
something is his name or eric or

982
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
something is his name or eric or
 

983
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,350
something is his name or eric or

his usb
 

997
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,029
his usb
dongle working so i may try that i'm a

998
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
dongle working so i may try that i'm a
 

999
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,630
dongle working so i may try that i'm a
little nervous about doing that but i

1000
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
little nervous about doing that but i
 

1001
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,510
little nervous about doing that but i
may try that

1002
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
may try that
 

1003
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,510
may try that
so we'll see what happens i'm going to

1004
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
so we'll see what happens i'm going to
 

1005
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,430
so we'll see what happens i'm going to
try the usb dongle first and see what

1006
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
try the usb dongle first and see what
 

1007
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,630
try the usb dongle first and see what
happens

1008
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
happens
 

1009
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,350
happens

because of the problem i've read because
 

1027
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,710
because of the problem i've read because

um you can't get up into this country

1030
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
um you can't get up into this country
 

1031
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,029
um you can't get up into this country
so i've discovered a way of doing it by

1032

who are listening in

1042
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
who are listening in
 

1043
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,789
who are listening in
so well anyway

1044
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
so well anyway
 

1045
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,950
so well anyway
so um when we do that we can get

1046
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
so um when we do that we can get
 

1047
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,870
so um when we do that we can get
together here to get things sorted out

1048
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
together here to get things sorted out
 

1049
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,470
together here to get things sorted out
again the boxes already out the other

1050
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
again the boxes already out the other
 

1051
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,950
again the boxes already out the other
one i built so so we're waiting for

1052
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
one i built so so we're waiting for
 

1053
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,430
one i built so so we're waiting for
pcb and all sorts of other stuff i

1054
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
pcb and all sorts of other stuff i
 

1055
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,630
pcb and all sorts of other stuff i
didn't buy

1056
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
didn't buy
 

1057
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,750
didn't buy
i did buy a a gps uh

1058
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
i did buy a a gps uh
 

1059
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,950
i did buy a a gps uh
messenger uh i'm trying to tell uh

1060
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
messenger uh i'm trying to tell uh
 

1061
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,750
messenger uh i'm trying to tell uh
the other day but basically it is a

1062
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
the other day but basically it is a
 

1063
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,510
the other day but basically it is a
pre-running oscillator

1064
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
pre-running oscillator
 

1065
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,710
pre-running oscillator
that uh runs at 10 megs and if i got

1066
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
that uh runs at 10 megs and if i got
 

1067
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,350
that uh runs at 10 megs and if i got
looped

1068
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
looped
 

1069
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,470
looped
onto uh ugps due to

1070
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
onto uh ugps due to
 

1071
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,470
onto uh ugps due to
the uh atomic clocking gps thing to lock

1072
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
the uh atomic clocking gps thing to lock
 

1073
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,630
the uh atomic clocking gps thing to lock
on the frequency

1074
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
on the frequency
 

1075
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,630
on the frequency
what does that do for you peter it could

1076
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
what does that do for you peter it could
 

1077
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,270
what does that do for you peter it could
be a frequency standard with one bar

1078
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
be a frequency standard with one bar
 

1079
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,549
be a frequency standard with one bar
in 10 to the seven ten by no

1080
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
in 10 to the seven ten by no
 

1081
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,230
in 10 to the seven ten by no
right but are you using that as a time

1082
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
right but are you using that as a time
 

1083
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,390
right but are you using that as a time
base for your uh for the other machines

1084
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
base for your uh for the other machines
 

1085
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,750
base for your uh for the other machines
in your network

1086
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760

 

1087
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,830

so you're picking up the time the actual

1088
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
so you're picking up the time the actual
 

1089
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,310
so you're picking up the time the actual
time of day from the gps satellites then

1090
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
time of day from the gps satellites then
 

1091
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,029
time of day from the gps satellites then
right

1092
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
right
 

1093
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,510
right
yeah and you use it on the clock though

1094
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
yeah and you use it on the clock though
 

1095
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,590
yeah and you use it on the clock though
there's a free running oscillator inside

1096
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
there's a free running oscillator inside
 

1097
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,510
there's a free running oscillator inside
the box

1098
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
the box
 

1099
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,350
the box
and that runs at uh roughly 10 megs and

1100
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
and that runs at uh roughly 10 megs and
 

1101
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,110
and that runs at uh roughly 10 megs and
then the gps

1102
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
then the gps
 

1103
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,390
then the gps
in satellite there's a atomic clock in

1104
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
in satellite there's a atomic clock in
 

1105
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,110
in satellite there's a atomic clock in
there a

1106
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
there a
 

1107
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,230
there a
rubidium probably and uh

1108
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
rubidium probably and uh
 

1109
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,669
rubidium probably and uh
and then that um locks on to the

1110
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
and then that um locks on to the
 

1111
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,070
and then that um locks on to the
base lock loops the oscillator back onto

1112
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
base lock loops the oscillator back onto
 

1113
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,510
base lock loops the oscillator back onto
their max all the time

1114
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
their max all the time
 

1115
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,350
their max all the time
well i get i get how you're looking for

1116
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
well i get i get how you're looking for
 

1117
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,270
well i get i get how you're looking for
a stable 10 megahertz signal

1118
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
a stable 10 megahertz signal
 

1119
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,950
a stable 10 megahertz signal
but i'm still not sure about the time um

1120
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
but i'm still not sure about the time um
 

1121
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,110
but i'm still not sure about the time um
the time from the gps how are you

1122
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
the time from the gps how are you
 

1123
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,350
the time from the gps how are you
picking that up

1124
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
picking that up
 

1125
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,470
picking that up
like that

1126
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480

 

1127
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,510

oh i get i get that but what are you

1128
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
oh i get i get that but what are you
 

1129
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,430
oh i get i get that but what are you
reading off the gps

1130
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
reading off the gps
 

1131
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,350
reading off the gps
once you've once you're hearing a gps

1132
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
once you've once you're hearing a gps
 

1133
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,350
once you've once you're hearing a gps
signal what are you doing on that with

1134
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
signal what are you doing on that with
 

1135
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,230
signal what are you doing on that with
that signal

1136
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
that signal
 

1137
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,710
that signal
well when the extend gps signal they

1138
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
well when the extend gps signal they
 

1139
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,350
well when the extend gps signal they
send

1140
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
send
 

1141
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,950
send
uh they they send their the

1142
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
uh they they send their the
 

1143
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,909
uh they they send their the
locations and the test calls in it and

1144
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
locations and the test calls in it and
 

1145
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,310
locations and the test calls in it and
they also then a clock frequency which

1146
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
they also then a clock frequency which
 

1147
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,710
they also then a clock frequency which
is

1148
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
is
 

1149
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,510
is
built inside the jeep themselves like

1150
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
built inside the jeep themselves like
 

1151
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,549
built inside the jeep themselves like
which is right

1152
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
which is right
 

1153
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,710
which is right
which is very accurate and you'll turn

1154
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
which is very accurate and you'll turn
 

1155
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,149
which is very accurate and you'll turn
that to lock onto the oscillator

1156
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
that to lock onto the oscillator
 

1157
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,070
that to lock onto the oscillator
used to be bidding for what purpose

1158
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
used to be bidding for what purpose
 

1159
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,230
used to be bidding for what purpose
though for what purpose though

1160
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
though for what purpose though
 

1161
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,789
though for what purpose though
what are you using that time signal for

1162
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
what are you using that time signal for
 

1163
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,430
what are you using that time signal for
at

1164
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
at
 

1165
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,990
at
the very standard for a for measuring

1166
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
the very standard for a for measuring
 

1167
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,549
the very standard for a for measuring
frequency and all sorts of other things

1168
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
frequency and all sorts of other things
 

1169
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,789
frequency and all sorts of other things
okay okay good better than the quest

1170
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
okay okay good better than the quest
 

1171
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,710
okay okay good better than the quest
will be a lot better

1172
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
will be a lot better
 

1173
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,909
will be a lot better
a lot of computer rabidian is a

1174
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
a lot of computer rabidian is a
 

1175
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,270
a lot of computer rabidian is a
a um element where if if you

1176
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
a um element where if if you
 

1177
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,310
a um element where if if you
give it a a one off with two gigahertz

1178
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
give it a a one off with two gigahertz
 

1179
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,430
give it a a one off with two gigahertz
the electrons come off

1180
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
the electrons come off
 

1181
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,990
the electrons come off
or the other way around if you if you

1182
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
or the other way around if you if you
 

1183
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,990
or the other way around if you if you
put it in the tube and you eat it

1184
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
put it in the tube and you eat it
 

1185
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,510
put it in the tube and you eat it
electrons come off and every time

1186
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
electrons come off and every time
 

1187
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,750
electrons come off and every time
electron comes off you create

1188
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
electron comes off you create
 

1189
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,190
electron comes off you create
um you create a two gigahertz signal

1190
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
um you create a two gigahertz signal
 

1191
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,870
um you create a two gigahertz signal
from right because because of the energy

1192
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:12,880
from right because because of the energy
 

1193
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,710
from right because because of the energy
reserved all the time you know you can't

1194
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
reserved all the time you know you can't
 

1195
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,630
reserved all the time you know you can't
make or break then you've got to go

1196
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
make or break then you've got to go
 

1197
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,630
make or break then you've got to go
somewhere that goes up as rf

1198
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
somewhere that goes up as rf
 

1199
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,350
somewhere that goes up as rf
and then they use that to frequency to

1200
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
and then they use that to frequency to
 

1201
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,310
and then they use that to frequency to
divide down

1202
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
divide down
 

1203
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,149
divide down
to lock on to 10x okay so it sounds like

1204
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
to lock on to 10x okay so it sounds like
 

1205
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,990
to lock on to 10x okay so it sounds like
you're more interested in a stable 10

1206
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
you're more interested in a stable 10
 

1207
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,149
you're more interested in a stable 10
megahertz frequency than you are

1208
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
megahertz frequency than you are
 

1209
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,909
megahertz frequency than you are
any data that you might be able to pull

1210
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
any data that you might be able to pull
 

1211
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,510
any data that you might be able to pull
off the satellites right

1212
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
off the satellites right
 

1213
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,470
off the satellites right
i i i get radio i got very poor thing to

1214
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
i i i get radio i got very poor thing to
 

1215
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,029
i i i get radio i got very poor thing to
wear that's what i was laughing

1216
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
wear that's what i was laughing
 

1217
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,470
wear that's what i was laughing
the other day okay i get i'll sometimes

1218
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
the other day okay i get i'll sometimes
 

1219
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,590
the other day okay i get i'll sometimes
it works all right

1220
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
it works all right
 

1221
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,830
it works all right
then if i pull the power off i lose the

1222
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
then if i pull the power off i lose the
 

1223
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,789
then if i pull the power off i lose the
signal and

1224
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
signal and
 

1225
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,390
signal and
i have to wait a long time so it comes

1226
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
i have to wait a long time so it comes
 

1227
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,470
i have to wait a long time so it comes
back again interesting

1228
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
back again interesting
 

1229
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,070
back again interesting
okay this thing this thing is supposed

1230
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
okay this thing this thing is supposed
 

1231
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,390
okay this thing this thing is supposed
to have a gps chip inside it but

1232
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
to have a gps chip inside it but
 

1233
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,110
to have a gps chip inside it but
um but it doesn't seem to at least the

1234
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
um but it doesn't seem to at least the
 

1235
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,630
um but it doesn't seem to at least the
software doesn't seem to be picking it

1236
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
software doesn't seem to be picking it
 

1237
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,190
software doesn't seem to be picking it
up

1238
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
up
 

1239
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,110
up
when you dig down into the command line

1240
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
when you dig down into the command line
 

1241
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,390
when you dig down into the command line
what will happen is

1242
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
what will happen is
 

1243
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,230
what will happen is
yeah show us what's on the display what

1244
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
yeah show us what's on the display what
 

1245
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,909
yeah show us what's on the display what
what does the display show it's very

1246
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
what does the display show it's very
 

1247
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,750
what does the display show it's very
yellow to me right now

1248
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760

 

1249
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,870

can you put it a bit closer to your um

1250
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
can you put it a bit closer to your um
 

1251
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,750
can you put it a bit closer to your um
to your screen or to your camera

1252
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
to your screen or to your camera
 

1253
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,950
to your screen or to your camera
let's see here

1254
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960

 

1255
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,950

gps no fix it says okay

1256
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
gps no fix it says okay
 

1257
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,310
gps no fix it says okay
wow okay i couldn't read that

1258
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
wow okay i couldn't read that
 

1259
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,830
wow okay i couldn't read that
yeah so it says it says gps no fix but

1260
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
yeah so it says it says gps no fix but
 

1261
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,149
yeah so it says it says gps no fix but
if you get a fix on the gps you will be

1262
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
if you get a fix on the gps you will be
 

1263
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,590
if you get a fix on the gps you will be
able to at least get utc

1264
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
able to at least get utc
 

1265
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,110
able to at least get utc
right you'll be able to get the time

1266
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
right you'll be able to get the time
 

1267
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,350
right you'll be able to get the time
yeah yeah but sometimes it uh

1268
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
yeah yeah but sometimes it uh
 

1269
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,350
yeah yeah but sometimes it uh
it it it's there for a while and i need

1270
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
it it it's there for a while and i need
 

1271
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,549
it it it's there for a while and i need
to die so

1272
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,559
to die so
 

1273
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,750
to die so
go uh but i mean funny because

1274
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
go uh but i mean funny because
 

1275
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,149
go uh but i mean funny because
once you know i've got several gps

1276
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
once you know i've got several gps
 

1277
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,390
once you know i've got several gps
receivers and once they get a lock

1278
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
receivers and once they get a lock
 

1279
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,390
receivers and once they get a lock
they tend to stay on as long as as long

1280
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
they tend to stay on as long as as long
 

1281
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,310
they tend to stay on as long as as long
as the radio is running

1282
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
as the radio is running
 

1283
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,470
as the radio is running
is that a kit that you put together or

1284
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
is that a kit that you put together or
 

1285
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:08,549
is that a kit that you put together or
what did you

1286
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559

 

1287
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,909

okay yeah which is quite interesting

1288
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
okay yeah which is quite interesting
 

1289
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,710
okay yeah which is quite interesting
um that's a bit of physics there but

1290
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
um that's a bit of physics there but
 

1291
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,669
um that's a bit of physics there but
yeah yeah

1292
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
yeah yeah
 

1293
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,110
yeah yeah
yeah yeah they're quite quite

1294
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
yeah yeah they're quite quite
 

1295
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,830
yeah yeah they're quite quite
interesting they're very nice

1296
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
interesting they're very nice
 

1297
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,789
interesting they're very nice
so does that thing that you showed us

1298
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
so does that thing that you showed us
 

1299
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,789
so does that thing that you showed us
does that also act as a time source as

1300
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
does that also act as a time source as
 

1301
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,510
does that also act as a time source as
well as

1302
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
well as
 

1303
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,230
well as
a yeah yeah you put it on the network

1304
