00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,550
just i i wanted to know because the
raspberry pi doesn't have a real-time

350
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
raspberry pi doesn't have a real-time
 

351
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,550
raspberry pi doesn't have a real-time
clock i just wanted to know if you

352
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
clock i just wanted to know if you
 

353
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,550
clock i just wanted to know if you
had set the date and time on your

354
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
had set the date and time on your
 

355
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,790
had set the date and time on your
raspberry pi because if you haven't

356
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
raspberry pi because if you haven't
 

357
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,270
raspberry pi because if you haven't
then all ssh keys will be invalid

358
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
then all ssh keys will be invalid
 

359
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,350
then all ssh keys will be invalid
because the date and time don't matter

360
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360

 

361

okay you'll see a tool there that

374
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
okay you'll see a tool there that
 

375
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,270
okay you'll see a tool there that
is how to set the linux date and time

376
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
is how to set the linux date and time
 

377
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,189
is how to set the linux date and time
and it gives you a quick little copy and

378
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
and it gives you a quick little copy and
 

379
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,710
and it gives you a quick little copy and
paste command you can throw in there and

380
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
paste command you can throw in there and
 

381
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,309
paste command you can throw in there and
it'll automatically set it for you

382
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
it'll automatically set it for you
 

383
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,029
it'll automatically set it for you
all right your raspberry pi because it

384
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
all right your raspberry pi because it
 

385
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,629
all right your raspberry pi because it
doesn't have a real-time clock

386
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
doesn't have a real-time clock
 

387
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,189
doesn't have a real-time clock
you need to have ntp installed once

388
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
you need to have ntp installed once
 

389
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,629
you need to have ntp installed once
you've got it up and going with the date

390
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
you've got it up and going with the date
 

391
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,670
you've got it up and going with the date
and time set man

392
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
and time set man
 

393
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,830
and time set man
okay so in order to automatically

394
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
okay so in order to automatically
 

395
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,950
okay so in order to automatically
synchronize it

396
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
synchronize it
 

397
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,830
synchronize it
raspbian must have that in it it does

398
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
raspbian must have that in it it does
 

399
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,950
raspbian must have that in it it does
come with it yeah

400
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
come with it yeah
 

401

411
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,149
oh he's asking he's saying that
the command is dead is asking if date is

412
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159

there's
 

419
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,870
there's
there's like syntax and you've got a you

420
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
there's like syntax and you've got a you
 

421
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,630
there's like syntax and you've got a you
have to use like the rtc

422
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
have to use like the rtc
 

423
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,590
have to use like the rtc
standard time stamp so just if you jump

424
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
standard time stamp so just if you jump
 

425
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,110
standard time stamp so just if you jump
on my blog i've written a tool that just

426
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
on my blog i've written a tool that just
 

427
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,630
on my blog i've written a tool that just
makes it easy you choose your time zone

428
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
makes it easy you choose your time zone
 

429
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,550
makes it easy you choose your time zone
and you copy and paste and you're done

430
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
and you copy and paste and you're done
 

431
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,870
and you copy and paste and you're done
so hopefully that'll fix it fix it for

um well i've tried uh using ubuntu
instead of raspbian

466
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
instead of raspbian
 

467
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,949

because i was having problems getting
 

469
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,590
because i was having problems getting
wide vine to load into raspbian it

731
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,550

from 40 years ago

732
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
from 40 years ago
 

733
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,509
from 40 years ago
in a doctor's office um there were two

734
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
in a doctor's office um there were two
 

735
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,870
in a doctor's office um there were two
deaf people

736
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
deaf people
 

737
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,749
deaf people
and the mask had a clear space right

738
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
and the mask had a clear space right
 

739
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,509
and the mask had a clear space right
across the mouth so they could read like

740
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
across the mouth so they could read like
 

741
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,069
across the mouth so they could read like
oh yeah

742
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
oh yeah
 

743
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,350
oh yeah

744
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360

 

745
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,470

one of the thing prizes me is how much

746
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
one of the thing prizes me is how much
 

747
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,910
one of the thing prizes me is how much
maybe i'm just getting death or

748
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
maybe i'm just getting death or
 

749
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,230
maybe i'm just getting death or
something but hence i rely

750
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
something but hence i rely
 

751
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,670
something but hence i rely
i've tried to rely on on movement

752
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
i've tried to rely on on movement
 

753
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,990
i've tried to rely on on movement
to understand what people are saying

754
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
to understand what people are saying
 

755
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,189
to understand what people are saying
it's quite surprising

756
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
it's quite surprising
 

757
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,030
it's quite surprising
like if i'm a noisy environment and i

758
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
like if i'm a noisy environment and i

try to um read them out but it's
 

763
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,550
try to um read them out but it's
impossible to do that if they're wearing

764
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
impossible to do that if they're wearing
 

765
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,110
impossible to do that if they're wearing
a mask

766
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
