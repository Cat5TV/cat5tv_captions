going on for me
i'm um i having a hard time getting

30
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
i'm um i having a hard time getting
 

31
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,350
i'm um i having a hard time getting
motivated this week so

32
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
motivated this week so
 

33
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,630
motivated this week so
um um you know little things that i can

34
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
um um you know little things that i can
 

35
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,190
um um you know little things that i can
show you

36
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
show you
 

37
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,229
show you
uh that i did get the uh the pogo pins

38
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
uh that i did get the uh the pogo pins
 

39
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,510
uh that i did get the uh the pogo pins
for the um for the time for the pine

40
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
for the um for the time for the pine
 

41
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,029
for the um for the time for the pine
time

42
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
time
 

43
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,630
time
and what that means is that now i can

44
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
and what that means is that now i can
 

45
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,910
and what that means is that now i can
program it much much easier because what

46
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
program it much much easier because what
 

47
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,189
program it much much easier because what
happens is let's see if

48
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
happens is let's see if
 

49
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,630
happens is let's see if
see if it'll focus on it doesn't look

50
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
see if it'll focus on it doesn't look
 

51
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,029
see if it'll focus on it doesn't look
like it will but those pins are fine

52
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
like it will but those pins are fine
 

53
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,070
like it will but those pins are fine
enough that they fit

54
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
enough that they fit
 

55
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,590
enough that they fit
exactly on the they fit exactly on the

56
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
exactly on the they fit exactly on the
 

57
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,030
exactly on the they fit exactly on the
um on the pine time pins and so you

58
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
um on the pine time pins and so you
 

59
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,149
um on the pine time pins and so you
literally just

60
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
literally just
 

61
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,230
literally just
stick them down on the pins and then

62
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
stick them down on the pins and then
 

63
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,990
stick them down on the pins and then
program them on this side

64
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
program them on this side
 

65
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,070
program them on this side
so i've i got it there's the adapter

66
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
so i've i got it there's the adapter
 

67
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,510
so i've i got it there's the adapter
cable but i haven't actually

68
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
cable but i haven't actually
 

69
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,789
cable but i haven't actually
done anything with it so i need to

70
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
done anything with it so i need to
 

71
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,749
done anything with it so i need to
i need to program the um the prime time

72
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
i need to program the um the prime time
 

73
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,390
i need to program the um the prime time
and get it

74
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
and get it
 

75
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,910
and get it
get it running it's been sitting there

76
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
get it running it's been sitting there
 

77
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,429
get it running it's been sitting there
it's been bricked because i

78
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
it's been bricked because i
 

79
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,749
it's been bricked because i
i unlocked it so that i could program it

80
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
i unlocked it so that i could program it
 

81
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,510
i unlocked it so that i could program it
but then i didn't do anything with it

82
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
but then i didn't do anything with it
 

83
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,310
but then i didn't do anything with it
so because i wasn't able to hold the

84
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
so because i wasn't able to hold the
 

85
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,950
so because i wasn't able to hold the
pins

86
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
pins
 

87
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,469
pins
you know i had four pins that i was

88
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
you know i had four pins that i was
 

89
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,390
you know i had four pins that i was
trying to you know man handle

90
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
trying to you know man handle
 

91
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,990
trying to you know man handle
manually and i couldn't do it it just

92
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
manually and i couldn't do it it just
 

93
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,149
manually and i couldn't do it it just
wouldn't those pins wouldn't stay there

94
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
wouldn't those pins wouldn't stay there
 

95
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,429
wouldn't those pins wouldn't stay there
long enough for me to

96
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
long enough for me to
 

97
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,950
long enough for me to
successfully program it so uh so yeah

98
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
successfully program it so uh so yeah
 

99
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,590

188
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
with that so i may have to do a bit of a
 

189
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,390
with that so i may have to do a bit of a
work around around that but

190
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
work around around that but

then you need to
tell postage to look in that same place

and i felt like that was the best thing
 

219
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,790

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
yeah repairing machine still under
 

499
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,630
yeah repairing machine still under
warranty yeah yeah exactly

so i put the emmc that was destined for

502
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
so i put the emmc that was destined for
 

503
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,069
so i put the emmc that was destined for
that machine

504
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
that machine
 

505
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,269
that machine
into my main machine

506
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
into my main machine
 

507
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,829
into my main machine
however linux doesn't see it and the

508
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
however linux doesn't see it and the
 

509
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,990
however linux doesn't see it and the
reason linux doesn't see it after i

510
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
reason linux doesn't see it after i
 

511
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,230
reason linux doesn't see it after i
uh search the internet for a while the

512
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
uh search the internet for a while the
 

513
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,590
uh search the internet for a while the
reason linux doesn't see it is because

514
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
reason linux doesn't see it is because
 

515
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,150
reason linux doesn't see it is because
um it's that the bios

516
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
um it's that the bios
 

517
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,870
um it's that the bios
have the hard drive set up as raid not

518
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
have the hard drive set up as raid not
 

519
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,910
have the hard drive set up as raid not
um

520
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
um
 

521
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,949
um
ahci or whatever the ychi or whatever

522
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
ahci or whatever the ychi or whatever
 

523
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,670
ahci or whatever the ychi or whatever
the

524
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
the
 

525
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,389
the
alternative um setup is so i need to

526
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
alternative um setup is so i need to
 

527
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,590
alternative um setup is so i need to
configure the bios to be ahci i forget

528
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
configure the bios to be ahci i forget
 

529
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,389
configure the bios to be ahci i forget
which way

530
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
which way
 

531
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,670
which way
those letters work but once i've done

532
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
those letters work but once i've done
 

533
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,389
those letters work but once i've done
that

534
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
that
 

535
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,550
that
then i should be able to boot off

536
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
then i should be able to boot off
 

537
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,509
then i should be able to boot off
windows

538
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
windows
 

539
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,389
windows
of the existing hard drive i think i

540
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
of the existing hard drive i think i
 

541
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,310
of the existing hard drive i think i
have to do this a very special way

542
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
have to do this a very special way
 

543
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,350
have to do this a very special way
because the windows drivers

544
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
because the windows drivers
 

545
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,430
because the windows drivers
that are on the hard drive now are

546
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
that are on the hard drive now are
 

547
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,790
that are on the hard drive now are
right now on a configured for raid

548
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
right now on a configured for raid
 

549
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,870
right now on a configured for raid
so they won't see any of the drive if if

550
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
so they won't see any of the drive if if
 

551
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,110
so they won't see any of the drive if if
i switch to bios without

552
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
i switch to bios without
 

553
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,949
i switch to bios without
doing these special steps in windows

554
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
doing these special steps in windows
 

555
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,790
doing these special steps in windows
first then

556
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
first then
 

557
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,670
first then
windows won't even see the the main

558
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
windows won't even see the the main
 

559
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,269
windows won't even see the the main
drive or the emmc

560
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
drive or the emmc
 

561
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,590
drive or the emmc
and and and i'll brick the machine so i

562
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
and and and i'll brick the machine so i
 

563
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,030
and and and i'll brick the machine so i
don't want to do that

564
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
don't want to do that
 

565
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,389
don't want to do that
so and there is also i have the same uh

566
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
so and there is also i have the same uh
 

567
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,750
so and there is also i have the same uh
issue with the my uh

568
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760

 

569
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,310

rack mounted server that i bought a year

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
rack mounted server that i bought a year
 

571
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,110
rack mounted server that i bought a year
ago

572
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
ago
 

573
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,430
ago
um i had a new drive that i wanted an

574
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
um i had a new drive that i wanted an
 

575
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,590
um i had a new drive that i wanted an
additional drive that i wanted to put

576
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
additional drive that i wanted to put
 

577
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,350
additional drive that i wanted to put
into it and it didn't see it

578
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
into it and it didn't see it
 

579
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,750
into it and it didn't see it
and it turned out it's um hardware

580
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
and it turned out it's um hardware
 

581
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,629
and it turned out it's um hardware
already

582
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
already
 

583
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,389
already
configured um yeah and someone told me

584
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
configured um yeah and someone told me
 

585
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,670
configured um yeah and someone told me
uh not too long ago that um

586
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
uh not too long ago that um
 

587
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,230
uh not too long ago that um
he had the same machine and he had to

588
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
he had the same machine and he had to
 

589
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,509
he had the same machine and he had to
turn off uh

590
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
turn off uh
 

591
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,190
turn off uh
uh hard and uh red and he had to turn it

592
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
uh hard and uh red and he had to turn it
 

593
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,590
uh hard and uh red and he had to turn it
off

594
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
off
 

595
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,949
off
somehow in the uh in the in the bios

596
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
somehow in the uh in the in the bios
 

597
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,829
somehow in the uh in the in the bios
configuration

598
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
configuration
 

599
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,190
configuration
but he also said that uh any drive

600
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
but he also said that uh any drive
 

601
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,670
but he also said that uh any drive
that was already formatted by that same

602
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
that was already formatted by that same
 

603
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,790
that was already formatted by that same
system

604
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
system
 

605
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,750
system
um you would not see anything again on

606
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
um you would not see anything again on
 

607
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,870
um you would not see anything again on
the drive unless

608
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
the drive unless
 

609
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,470
the drive unless
unless you turn the hardware in back

610
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
unless you turn the hardware in back
 

611
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,470
unless you turn the hardware in back
home so if your window system

612
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
home so if your window system
 

613
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,790
home so if your window system
was installed using hardware raid and

614
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
was installed using hardware raid and
 

615
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,710
was installed using hardware raid and
you turn it off in the bios then

616
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
you turn it off in the bios then
 

617
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,629
you turn it off in the bios then
you still can't see anything of that

618
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
you still can't see anything of that
 

619
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,790
you still can't see anything of that
file you have to format and start

620
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
file you have to format and start
 

621
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,069
file you have to format and start
from this yeah so i don't think i

622
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
from this yeah so i don't think i
 

623
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,590
from this yeah so i don't think i
don't think these steps require

624
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
don't think these steps require
 

625
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,910
don't think these steps require
reformatting the hard drive

626
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
reformatting the hard drive
 

627
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,030
reformatting the hard drive
they do require that you load certain

628
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
they do require that you load certain
 

629
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,710
they do require that you load certain
drivers in windows

630
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
drivers in windows
 

631
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,389
drivers in windows
before you switch the bios back to hci

632
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
before you switch the bios back to hci
 

633
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,670
before you switch the bios back to hci
or whatever it is

634
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
or whatever it is
 

635
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,990
or whatever it is
so as long as you take those steps in

636
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
so as long as you take those steps in
 

637
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,110
so as long as you take those steps in
the correct order it

638
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
the correct order it
 

639
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,629
the correct order it
should should work yeah but it also

640
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
should should work yeah but it also
 

641
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,310
should should work yeah but it also
depends on how the

642
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
depends on how the
 

643
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,230
depends on how the
red controller talk to the drive

644
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
red controller talk to the drive
 

645
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,590
red controller talk to the drive
and because it um it uh

646
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
and because it um it uh
 

647
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,150
and because it um it uh
if it is how the file system is um

648
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
if it is how the file system is um
 

649
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,110
if it is how the file system is um
is uh formatted it's the the red

650
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
is uh formatted it's the the red
 

651
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,389
is uh formatted it's the the red
controller uh

652
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
controller uh
 

653
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,710
controller uh
when it is in the hardware red mode it

654
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
when it is in the hardware red mode it
 

655
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,590
when it is in the hardware red mode it
does something

656
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
does something
 

657
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,790
does something
to the drive so you uh so if you have

658

you you can't just take those two drive
 

669
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,030
you you can't just take those two drive
out and put it in another system unless

that other system
 

673
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,030
that other system
has the exact same type of hardware rate

674
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
has the exact same type of hardware rate
 

675
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,629
has the exact same type of hardware rate
controller you can't just use software

676
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
controller you can't just use software
 

677
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,670
controller you can't just use software
and then read them

and then read them
 

679
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,990
and then read them
you want to i never even realized that

my old desktop into this one booted up
 

691
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,790
my old desktop into this one booted up
linux and that's all i ever run on this

692
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
linux and that's all i ever run on this
 

693
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,269
linux and that's all i ever run on this
machine

694
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
machine
 

695
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,269
machine
yeah i only switched to windows just

696
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
yeah i only switched to windows just
 

697

problem it never even occurred to me to
 

713
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,590
problem it never even occurred to me to
look at the bios

um do you mean that you're running it as
 

781
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,790
um do you mean that you're running it as
a service on your machine that your

782
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
a service on your machine that your
 

783

other machines sync to
 

785
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,310
other machines sync to
well you you can't you can run it on

786
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
well you you can't you can run it on
 

787
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,590
well you you can't you can run it on
your own server

788
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
your own server
 

789
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,110
your own server
but i'm actually on etisync have

790
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
but i'm actually on etisync have
 

791
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,829
but i'm actually on etisync have
a server set up and you can use that

792
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
a server set up and you can use that
 

793
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,230
a server set up and you can use that
and what you do is you get a free trial

794
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
and what you do is you get a free trial
 

795

00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
this desktop this time gets backed up
 

875
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,029
this desktop this time gets backed up
all the time so

all the time so
 

877
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,470
all the time so
that's the interesting thing with et

00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
got the data
 

889
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,270
got the data
it's just a blob okay but the problem is

890
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
it's just a blob okay but the problem is
 

891
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,630
it's just a blob okay but the problem is
if they go away

892

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
each do we think
 

1145
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,669
each do we think
uh so you're literally fixing it

1146
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
uh so you're literally fixing it
 

1147
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,789
uh so you're literally fixing it

the help of transit
 

1153
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:07,110
the help of transit
to be replaced

1154
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120

 

1155
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,110

put to the airport to the socket and

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
put to the airport to the socket and
 

1157
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,310
put to the airport to the socket and
then we plug in

1158
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
then we plug in
 

1159
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,350
then we plug in
another ball time i designed that

1160
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
another ball time i designed that
 

1161
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,390

yeah when we test when we test circuits

1202
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
yeah when we test when we test circuits
 

1203
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,789
yeah when we test when we test circuits

we typically limit the current
 

1205
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,430
we typically limit the current
quite a bit so that uh you know you

1206
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
quite a bit so that uh you know you
 

1207
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,190
quite a bit so that uh you know you
don't just feed full current into it

1208
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
don't just feed full current into it
 

1209
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,870

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
uh older circuits and you do that on
 

1213
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,990
uh older circuits and you do that on
purpose so that

1214
