00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,670
phone
um you can put a dongle on that

166
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
um you can put a dongle on that
 

167
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,350
um you can put a dongle on that
and then you can attach a keyboard and a

168
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
and then you can attach a keyboard and a
 

169
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,030
and then you can attach a keyboard and a
mouse and all to the dongle

170
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
mouse and all to the dongle
 

171
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,990
mouse and all to the dongle
and even an hdmi out uh output for the

172
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
and even an hdmi out uh output for the
 

173
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,949
and even an hdmi out uh output for the
string

174
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
string
 

175
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,949
string
theoretically you can power it too but

176
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
theoretically you can power it too but
 

177
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,270
theoretically you can power it too but
none of that works on this phone because

178
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
none of that works on this phone because
 

179
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,390
none of that works on this phone because
the main board on this phone doesn't uh

180
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
the main board on this phone doesn't uh
 

181
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,430
the main board on this phone doesn't uh
doesn't allow activation of that um

182
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
doesn't allow activation of that um
 

183
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,589
doesn't allow activation of that um
of that dongle so i'm pretty much hosed

184
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
of that dongle so i'm pretty much hosed
 

185
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,509
of that dongle so i'm pretty much hosed
i have my the two choices are i could

186
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
i have my the two choices are i could
 

187
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,830
i have my the two choices are i could
replace the main board which is probably

188
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
replace the main board which is probably
 

189
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,110
replace the main board which is probably
what i'll do

190
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
what i'll do
 

191
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,830
what i'll do
or um and amir droid and i talked about

192
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
or um and amir droid and i talked about
 

193
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,630
or um and amir droid and i talked about
this

194
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
this
 

195
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,030
this
modifying the main board by by literally

196
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
modifying the main board by by literally
 

197
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,190
modifying the main board by by literally
removing some components

198
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
removing some components
 

199
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,229
removing some components
so they're very small components and to

200
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
so they're very small components and to
 

201
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:44,869
so they're very small components and to
my point

202
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
my point
 

203
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,949
my point
very hard to understand very hard to

204
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
very hard to understand very hard to
 

205
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,390
very hard to understand very hard to
locate so i don't want to rip out the

206
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
locate so i don't want to rip out the
 

207
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,630
locate so i don't want to rip out the
wrong components

208
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
wrong components
 

209
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,789
wrong components
yeah the lava ball before the

210
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
yeah the lava ball before the
 

211
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,630
yeah the lava ball before the
motherboard before the one before the

212
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
motherboard before the one before the
 

213

they put the uh security uh code on

218
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
they put the uh security uh code on
 

219
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,509
they put the uh security uh code on
on the files and you couldn't get it off

220
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
on the files and you couldn't get it off
 

221
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,830
on the files and you couldn't get it off
so the only way we did it was we changed

222
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
so the only way we did it was we changed
 

223
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,750
so the only way we did it was we changed
the motherboard we paid very little for

224
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
the motherboard we paid very little for
 

225
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,869

the motherboard
 

227
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,870
the motherboard
and we played old bloody motherboard and

and we played old bloody motherboard and
 

229
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,550
and we played old bloody motherboard and
uh it was wow

231
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,349
uh it was wow
yeah yeah yeah and no one thought about

232
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
yeah yeah yeah and no one thought about
 

233
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,550
yeah yeah yeah and no one thought about
removing the battery and

234
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
removing the battery and
 

235
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,710
removing the battery and
uh leaving it for half an hour it

236
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
uh leaving it for half an hour it
 

237
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,790
uh leaving it for half an hour it
doesn't work it didn't work it couldn't

that's probably in persistent memory

240
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
that's probably in persistent memory
 

241
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,110
that's probably in persistent memory
right

242
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
right
 

243
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,469

he was logged
he couldn't get help yeah so this

250
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
he couldn't get help yeah so this
 

251
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,110
he couldn't get help yeah so this
so this is completely open hardware um

252
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
so this is completely open hardware um
 

253
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,230

there's nothing special about this right
 

357
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,230
there's nothing special about this right
i mean i've shown this to you before

358
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
i mean i've shown this to you before
 

359
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,430
i mean i've shown this to you before
but the pogo pins are on a plastic

360
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
but the pogo pins are on a plastic
 

361
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,830
but the pogo pins are on a plastic
carrier that is shaped and sized much

362
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
carrier that is shaped and sized much
 

363

tack on this case
 

379
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,909
tack on this case
to try and hold the thing in place so

380
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
to try and hold the thing in place so
 

381
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,749
to try and hold the thing in place so
that i could put these here and

382
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
that i could put these here and
 

383
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,629
that i could put these here and
and hope the hope against hope that this

384
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
and hope the hope against hope that this
 

385
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,589
and hope the hope against hope that this
thing would hold

386
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
thing would hold
 

387
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,510
thing would hold
long enough to allow me to program it

388
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
long enough to allow me to program it
 

389
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,029
long enough to allow me to program it
and i never really did have any luck

390
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
and i never really did have any luck
 

391

i remember

758

i remember
 

759
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,269
i remember
yes i remember the motivation that like

760
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
yes i remember the motivation that like
 

761
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,470
yes i remember the motivation that like
uh that linus had

762
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
uh that linus had
 

763
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,509
uh that linus had
to um uh uh to to write linux

764
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
to um uh uh to to write linux
 

765
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,590
to um uh uh to to write linux
for sure um so if the unix companies

766
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
for sure um so if the unix companies
 

767
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,629
for sure um so if the unix companies
had a reasonable process back then there

768
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
had a reasonable process back then there
 

769
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,110
had a reasonable process back then there
and

770
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
and
 

771
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,550
and
all of this would not have happened yeah

772
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
all of this would not have happened yeah
 

773
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,389
all of this would not have happened yeah
but would it still be i wonder if the

774
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
but would it still be i wonder if the
 

775
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,910
but would it still be i wonder if the
open source

776
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
open source
 

777
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,790
open source
industry or drive would be as powerful

778
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
industry or drive would be as powerful
 

779
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,389
industry or drive would be as powerful
now as a

780
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
now as a
 

781
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,990
now as a
you know if because none of the unix

782
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
you know if because none of the unix
 

783
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,749
you know if because none of the unix
distros would be open source would they

784
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
distros would be open source would they
 

785
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,030
distros would be open source would they
they are all closed source

786
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
they are all closed source
 

787
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,150
they are all closed source
they are all posters yes yeah so

788
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
they are all posters yes yeah so
 

789
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,870
they are all posters yes yeah so
the free software movement they started

790
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
the free software movement they started
 

791
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,870
the free software movement they started
rewriting from scratch

792
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
rewriting from scratch
 

793
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,470
rewriting from scratch
all the utilities that that you needed

794
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
all the utilities that that you needed
 

795
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,829
all the utilities that that you needed
for have a full system and in 1991 all

796
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
for have a full system and in 1991 all
 

797
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,990
for have a full system and in 1991 all
the single uh component missing

798
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
the single uh component missing
 

799
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,030
the single uh component missing
was the kernel and they had started

800
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
was the kernel and they had started
 

801
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,430
was the kernel and they had started
building a kernel but it was uh hard to

802
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
building a kernel but it was uh hard to
 

803
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,790
building a kernel but it was uh hard to
debug because it was uh

804
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
debug because it was uh
 

805
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,990
debug because it was uh
a modular uh uh monolithic

806
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
a modular uh uh monolithic
 

807
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,910
a modular uh uh monolithic
yes so they had their installment

808
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
yes so they had their installment
 

809
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,030
yes so they had their installment
explain this in

810
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
explain this in
 

811
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,870
explain this in
one of the uh linux documentaries who

812
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
one of the uh linux documentaries who
 

813
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,230
one of the uh linux documentaries who
who are uh 20 years ago this year and he

814
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
who are uh 20 years ago this year and he
 

815
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,749
who are uh 20 years ago this year and he
explained it that um

816
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
explained it that um
 

817
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,990
explained it that um
the hard part was that they could

818
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
the hard part was that they could
 

819
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,350
the hard part was that they could
communicate the more modules

820
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
communicate the more modules
 

821
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,150
communicate the more modules
communicated

822
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
communicated
 

823
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,110
communicated
sending messages to each other but the

824
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
sending messages to each other but the
 

825
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,749
sending messages to each other but the
problem is

826
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
problem is
 

827
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,629
problem is
does this message come before or after

828
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
does this message come before or after
 

829
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,230
does this message come before or after
this one sent this message

830
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
this one sent this message
 

831
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,310
this one sent this message
so that is always that is always a

832
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
so that is always that is always a
 

833
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,069
so that is always that is always a
problem with messaging systems

834
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
problem with messaging systems
 

835
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,150
problem with messaging systems
yeah um i worked with the technology

836
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
yeah um i worked with the technology
 

837
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,510
yeah um i worked with the technology
several years ago called corba

838
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
several years ago called corba
 

839
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,630
several years ago called corba
which is a a similar thing we the

840
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
which is a a similar thing we the
 

841
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,870
which is a a similar thing we the
company i worked for sold a product that

842
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
company i worked for sold a product that
 

843
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,390
company i worked for sold a product that
implemented that standard

844
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
implemented that standard
 

845
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,270
implemented that standard
and we had a message bus a product as

846
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
and we had a message bus a product as
 

847
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,069
and we had a message bus a product as
part of that

848
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
part of that
 

849
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,309
part of that
and bundled as part of that package and

850
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
and bundled as part of that package and
 

851
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,510
and bundled as part of that package and
that was always

852
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
that was always
 

853
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,270
that was always
that was always an issue you had to make

854
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
that was always an issue you had to make
 

855
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,510
that was always an issue you had to make
sure you had to specify when you built a

856
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
sure you had to specify when you built a
 

857
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,069
sure you had to specify when you built a
cue

858
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
cue
 

859
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,270
cue
that messages traveled on you had to say

860
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
that messages traveled on you had to say
 

861
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,950
that messages traveled on you had to say
whether it was important that the

862
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
whether it was important that the
 

863
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,430
whether it was important that the
messages were delivered in exactly the

864
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
messages were delivered in exactly the
 

865
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,070
messages were delivered in exactly the
same order

866
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
same order
 

867
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,230
same order
as they were placed on the queue because

868
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
as they were placed on the queue because
 

869
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,510
as they were placed on the queue because
if they

870
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
if they
 

871
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,270
if they
you know if it didn't matter and one

872
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
you know if it didn't matter and one
 

873
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,950
you know if it didn't matter and one
message got lost or something then you

874
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
message got lost or something then you
 

875
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,470
message got lost or something then you
could just keep on going

876
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
could just keep on going
 

877
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,029
could just keep on going
but you had to then make sure you

878
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
but you had to then make sure you
 

879
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,870
but you had to then make sure you
allowed for a message

880
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
allowed for a message
 

881
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,430
allowed for a message
that might be missing um but if it

882
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
that might be missing um but if it
 

883
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,630
that might be missing um but if it
mattered

884
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
mattered
 

885
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,150
mattered
that the messages appeared in queue and

886
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
that the messages appeared in queue and
 

887
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,750
that the messages appeared in queue and
one one got dropped

888
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
one one got dropped
 

889
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,750
one one got dropped
potentially that would back messages up

890
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
potentially that would back messages up
 

891
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,950
potentially that would back messages up
until somehow

892
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
until somehow
 

893
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,070
until somehow
you you freed up that message so yeah it

894
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
you you freed up that message so yeah it
 

895
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,590
you you freed up that message so yeah it
got interesting

896
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
got interesting
 

897
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,350
got interesting
there's all kinds of interesting stuff

898
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
there's all kinds of interesting stuff
 

899
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,270
there's all kinds of interesting stuff
yeah and the interesting part uh

900
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
yeah and the interesting part uh
 

901
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,310
yeah and the interesting part uh
i watched um two or three years ago

there were two people
 

909
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,310
there were two people
who are important in creating um

started
 

925
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,710
started
and why it started and so on they had a

926
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
and why it started and so on they had a
 

927
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,710
and why it started and so on they had a
printer that they wanted to uh

928
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
printer that they wanted to uh
 

929
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,029
printer that they wanted to uh
get working right and on the printer

930
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
get working right and on the printer
 

931
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,630
get working right and on the printer
they wanted it was a

932
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
they wanted it was a
 

933
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,630
they wanted it was a
big and powerful um hardware so they

934
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
big and powerful um hardware so they
 

935
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,630
big and powerful um hardware so they
wanted to play games on the printer

936
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
wanted to play games on the printer
 

937
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,029
wanted to play games on the printer
that's how unique started that was the

938
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
that's how unique started that was the
 

939
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,110
that's how unique started that was the
justif i remember the justification was

justif i remember the justification was
 

941
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,390
justif i remember the justification was
a printer driver

942
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
a printer driver
 

943
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,710
a printer driver
um for sure i do remember that yeah and

944
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
um for sure i do remember that yeah and
 

945

he had worked on it for three weeks and
 

949
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,789
he had worked on it for three weeks and
the only he

950

the only he
 

951
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,870
the only he
only needed three parts there left there

952
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
only needed three parts there left there
 

953
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,029
only needed three parts there left there
were three programs that he needed

954
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
were three programs that he needed
 

955
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,710
were three programs that he needed
and at that point when he told the other

956

and at that point when he told the other
 

957
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,870
and at that point when he told the other
one what he was missing

958

one what he was missing
 

959
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,630
one what he was missing
it don't mean that he was creating a new

960
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
it don't mean that he was creating a new
 

961
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,070
it don't mean that he was creating a new
operating system and that was not

962
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
operating system and that was not
 

963
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,669
operating system and that was not
intentional

964
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679

version of ubuntu that i can put on my
 

989
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,669
version of ubuntu that i can put on my
raspberry pi 3.

990
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
raspberry pi 3.
 

991
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,789
raspberry pi 3.
i found one but when i try to boot it it

992
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
i found one but when i try to boot it it
 

993
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,350
i found one but when i try to boot it it
says it doesn't have ssh keys

994
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
says it doesn't have ssh keys
 

995
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,470
says it doesn't have ssh keys
so it won't boot all the way

996
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
so it won't boot all the way
 

997
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,909
so it won't boot all the way
now i've got to try to find a way to

998
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
now i've got to try to find a way to
 

999
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,950
now i've got to try to find a way to
solve that i found a link online

1000
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
solve that i found a link online
 

1001
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,870
solve that i found a link online
which will allow me to download ubuntu

1002
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:03,880
which will allow me to download ubuntu
 

1003
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,669
which will allow me to download ubuntu
20.04

1004
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
20.04
 

1005
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,590
20.04
so i'm going to try and see if i can

1006
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
so i'm going to try and see if i can
 

1007
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,870
so i'm going to try and see if i can
make that work

1008
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
make that work
 

1009
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,070
make that work
what does it need the ssh keys for

1010
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
what does it need the ssh keys for
 

1011
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,270
what does it need the ssh keys for
um i'm not sure uh

1012
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
um i'm not sure uh
 

1013
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,830
um i'm not sure uh
i'm not ssh not going to ssh

1014
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
i'm not ssh not going to ssh
 

1015
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,350
i'm not ssh not going to ssh
into this version of ubuntu

1016
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
into this version of ubuntu
 

1017
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,590
into this version of ubuntu
it must think it needs ssh in order to

1018
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
it must think it needs ssh in order to
 

1019
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,510
it must think it needs ssh in order to
talk to servers for package management

1020
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
talk to servers for package management
 

1021
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,310
talk to servers for package management
or something

1022
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
or something
 

1023
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,350
or something
yeah well the version i have is a server

1024
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
yeah well the version i have is a server
 

1025
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,390
yeah well the version i have is a server
version

1026
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
version
 

1027
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,070
version
so that might have something to do with

1028
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
so that might have something to do with
 

1029
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,830
so that might have something to do with
it well it shouldn't

1030
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
it well it shouldn't
 

1031
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,470
it well it shouldn't
um it destroys the destroys the district

1032
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
um it destroys the destroys the district
 

1033
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,430
um it destroys the destroys the district
pretty much

1034
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
pretty much
 

1035
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,990
pretty much
i really don't know much about ssh yeah

1036
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
i really don't know much about ssh yeah
 

1037
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,430
i really don't know much about ssh yeah
the things that define whether it's a

1038
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
the things that define whether it's a
 

1039
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,270
the things that define whether it's a
server version or whether it's a desktop

1040
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
server version or whether it's a desktop
 

1041
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,750
server version or whether it's a desktop
version is what packages get included

1042
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
version is what packages get included
 

1043
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,990
version is what packages get included
would you agree sober

1044
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000

 

1045
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,390

he's not listening he's he's off playing

1046
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
he's not listening he's he's off playing
 

1047
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,789
he's not listening he's he's off playing
he's had enough fun for one day

1048
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
he's had enough fun for one day
 

1049
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,110
he's had enough fun for one day
i i think what defines the difference

1050
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
i i think what defines the difference
 

1051
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,789
i i think what defines the difference
between a desktop

1052
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
between a desktop
 

1053
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,149
between a desktop
version and a server version of a of a

1054
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
version and a server version of a of a
 

1055
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,149
version and a server version of a of a
um

1056
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
um
 

1057
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,149
um
of a system is what packages get

1058
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
of a system is what packages get
 

1059
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,830
of a system is what packages get
included i don't think that this

1060
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
included i don't think that this
 

1061
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,430
included i don't think that this
yeah and the big difference is that on

1062
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
yeah and the big difference is that on
 

1063
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,190
yeah and the big difference is that on
the server and it's

1064
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
the server and it's
 

1065
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,070
the server and it's
by default you don't have a graphical

1066
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
by default you don't have a graphical
 

1067
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,549
by default you don't have a graphical
login

1068
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
login
 

1069
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,110
login
right right but you can install a

1070
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
right right but you can install a
 

1071
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,950
right right but you can install a
graphical login interface on the server

1072
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
graphical login interface on the server
 

1073
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,830
graphical login interface on the server
and so if doug is having trouble with

1074
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
and so if doug is having trouble with
 

1075
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,470
and so if doug is having trouble with
ssh

1076
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
ssh
 

1077
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,510
ssh
keys i suspect that it has to do with

1078
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
keys i suspect that it has to do with
 

1079
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,190
keys i suspect that it has to do with
the uh pc that or the raspberry pi that

1080
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
the uh pc that or the raspberry pi that
 

1081
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,470
the uh pc that or the raspberry pi that
you've installed it on

1082
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
you've installed it on
 

1083
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,549
you've installed it on
somehow needing keys to talk to the to

1084
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
somehow needing keys to talk to the to
 

1085
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,710
somehow needing keys to talk to the to
the server that manages the packages

1086
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
the server that manages the packages
 

1087
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,750
the server that manages the packages
that ubuntu needs to download that's my

1088
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
that ubuntu needs to download that's my
 

1089
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,070
that ubuntu needs to download that's my
that's that's my gut reaction there but

1090
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
that's that's my gut reaction there but
 

1091
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,789
that's that's my gut reaction there but
they sh

1092
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
they sh
 

1093
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,590
they sh
those ssh keys should have been included

1094
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
those ssh keys should have been included
 

1095
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,510
those ssh keys should have been included
on the distro that you downloaded so if

1096
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
on the distro that you downloaded so if
 

1097
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,549
on the distro that you downloaded so if
they're not there

1098
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
they're not there
 

1099
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,390
they're not there
i would be wondering if that distro that

1100
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
i would be wondering if that distro that
 

1101
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,390
i would be wondering if that distro that
you downloaded was complete

1102
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
you downloaded was complete
 

1103
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,390
you downloaded was complete
or not corrupted yeah well i would yeah

1104
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
or not corrupted yeah well i would yeah
 

1105
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,350
or not corrupted yeah well i would yeah
if it is the ssh key is there another

1106
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
if it is the ssh key is there another
 

1107
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,390
if it is the ssh key is there another
one

1108
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
one
 

1109
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,190
one
yeah exactly peter exactly peter yeah

1110
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
yeah exactly peter exactly peter yeah
 

1111
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,510
yeah exactly peter exactly peter yeah
yeah

1112
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
yeah
 

1113
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,669
yeah
download it again and try it again yeah

1114
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
download it again and try it again yeah
 

1115
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,070
download it again and try it again yeah
yeah well i'm going to try the 20.04 and

1116
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
yeah well i'm going to try the 20.04 and
 

1117
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,029
yeah well i'm going to try the 20.04 and
see if that works

1118
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
see if that works
 

1119
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,909
see if that works
yeah but uh what i think is going on is

1120
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
yeah but uh what i think is going on is
 

1121
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,029
yeah but uh what i think is going on is
uh

1122
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
uh
 

1123
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,149
uh
the the ssh keys they are not shipped in

1124
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
the the ssh keys they are not shipped in

uh that is the biggest security all is

1128
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
uh that is the biggest security all is
 

1129
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,590
uh that is the biggest security all is
shipping the ssshks because

shipping the ssshks because
 

1131
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,669
shipping the ssshks because
they will be the same all over if they

they will be the same all over if they
 

1133
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,950
they will be the same all over if they

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,830
demon package well then how are they how
do they

1142
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
do they
 

1143
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,750
do they
connect those keys back to the server in

1144
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
connect those keys back to the server in
 

1145
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,830
connect those keys back to the server in
order to get a good connection to get

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,669
packages
yeah the packages are not signed by ssh

1150
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
yeah the packages are not signed by ssh
 

1151
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,789
yeah the packages are not signed by ssh
they are signed by um

1152
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
they are signed by um
 

1153
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,830
they are signed by um
gpg pgp keys

1154
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
gpg pgp keys
 

1155
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,870
gpg pgp keys
so what are the ssh keys used for uh for

1156
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
so what are the ssh keys used for uh for
 

1157
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,590
so what are the ssh keys used for uh for
following

1158
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
following
 

1159
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,590
following
for logging in if they're logging in to

1160
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,600
for logging in if they're logging in to
 

1161
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,029
for logging in if they're logging in to
the

1162
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
the
 

1163
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,430
the
he doesn't care server that he doesn't

1164
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
he doesn't care server that he doesn't
 

1165
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,110
he doesn't care server that he doesn't
plan he doesn't care about doing that

1166
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
plan he doesn't care about doing that
 

1167
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,909
plan he doesn't care about doing that
but it won't boot without the ssh keys

1168
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919

 

1169
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,750

it might be having trouble generating

1170
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
it might be having trouble generating
 

1171
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,190
it might be having trouble generating
the ssh keys then

1172
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
the ssh keys then
 

1173
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,110
the ssh keys then
for before the first boot that might be

1174
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
for before the first boot that might be
 

1175
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,870
for before the first boot that might be
what it is yeah

1176
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
what it is yeah
 

1177
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,110
what it is yeah
and i believe i've had that problem with

1178
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
and i believe i've had that problem with
 

1179
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,549
and i believe i've had that problem with
um with raspberry pi

1180
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
um with raspberry pi
 

1181
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,070
um with raspberry pi
as well i think i think

1182
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
as well i think i think
 

1183
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,830
as well i think i think
when you try to do it it can't get a

1184
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
when you try to do it it can't get a
 

1185
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,750
when you try to do it it can't get a
random it can't get a source of random

1186
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
random it can't get a source of random
 

1187
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,630
random it can't get a source of random
data

1188
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
data
 

1189
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,430
data
yeah i remember um

1190
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440

 

1191
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,310

peter reynoldson um he is the one who

1192
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
peter reynoldson um he is the one who
 

1193
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,149
peter reynoldson um he is the one who
created the the installer that

1194
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
created the the installer that
 

1195
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,789
created the the installer that
debian and ubuntu uses and one of the

1196
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
debian and ubuntu uses and one of the
 

1197
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,830
debian and ubuntu uses and one of the
problems he had

1198
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
problems he had
 

1199
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,470
problems he had
10 years ago or 11 years ago i don't i'm

1200
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
10 years ago or 11 years ago i don't i'm
 

1201
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,350
10 years ago or 11 years ago i don't i'm
not sure

1202
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
not sure
 

1203
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,669
not sure
it was that um we have to we have to let

1204
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
it was that um we have to we have to let
 

1205
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,549
it was that um we have to we have to let
people have a guess

1206
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
people have a guess
 

1207
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,870
people have a guess
they had the same problem but they the

1208
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
they had the same problem but they the
 

1209
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,710
they had the same problem but they the
installer yeah it started

1210
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
installer yeah it started
 

1211
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,590
installer yeah it started
it started to install and then for some

1212
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
it started to install and then for some
 

1213
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,070
it started to install and then for some
at

1214
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
at
 

1215
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,510
at
some point um it just stopped and waited

1216
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,520
some point um it just stopped and waited
 

1217
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,789
some point um it just stopped and waited
for something

1218
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
for something
 

1219
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,789
for something
and then and he and he found that oh he

1220
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
and then and he and he found that oh he
 

1221
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,230
and then and he and he found that oh he
would have to type on his keyboard

1222
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
would have to type on his keyboard
 

1223
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,870
would have to type on his keyboard
didn't he

1224
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
didn't he
 

1225
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,190
didn't he
provide the random data okay if he found

1226
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
provide the random data okay if he found
 

1227
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,070
provide the random data okay if he found
out that

1228
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
out that
 

1229
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,190
out that
no matter what he did

1230
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200

 

1231
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,789

anything you did fix it fixed the

1232
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
anything you did fix it fixed the
 

1233
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,870
anything you did fix it fixed the
problem so it just needed some random

1234
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
problem so it just needed some random
 

1235
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,909
problem so it just needed some random
data so

1236
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
data so
 

1237
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,909
data so
i remember i remember you told us that

1238
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
i remember i remember you told us that
 

1239
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,830
i remember i remember you told us that
story a few weeks ago and coffee break

1240
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
story a few weeks ago and coffee break
 

1241
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,549
story a few weeks ago and coffee break
that's right

1242
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
that's right
 

1243
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,310
that's right
that might be your trick doug maybe it's

1244
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
that might be your trick doug maybe it's
 

1245
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,070
that might be your trick doug maybe it's
just waiting on random data and it can't

1246
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
just waiting on random data and it can't
 

1247
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,590
just waiting on random data and it can't
find it maybe you just have to move the

1248
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
find it maybe you just have to move the
 

1249
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:17,990
find it maybe you just have to move the
mouse

1250
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
mouse
 

1251
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,549
mouse
and and and just keep tapping on the

1252
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
and and and just keep tapping on the
 

1253
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,909
and and and just keep tapping on the
keyboard until it

1254
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
keyboard until it
 

1255
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,350
keyboard until it
until it's happy that it's got all the

1256
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
until it's happy that it's got all the
 

1257
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,230
until it's happy that it's got all the
source of data that it needs

1258
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
source of data that it needs
 

1259
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,390
source of data that it needs
one thing that he did was that he uh he

1260
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
one thing that he did was that he uh he
 

1261
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,310
one thing that he did was that he uh he
run the defined command in

1262
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
run the defined command in
 

1263
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,669
run the defined command in
one of the terminals in this

1264
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
one of the terminals in this
 

1265
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,750
one of the terminals in this
installation uh find

1266
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
installation uh find
 

1267
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,310
installation uh find
slash enter and hit it search it and

1268
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
slash enter and hit it search it and
 

1269
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,830
slash enter and hit it search it and
then it searched the entire

1270
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
then it searched the entire
 

1271
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,669
then it searched the entire
retrieve for anything and that was

1272
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
retrieve for anything and that was
 

1273
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,510
retrieve for anything and that was
enough for uh yeah because that would

1274
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
enough for uh yeah because that would
 

1275
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,590
enough for uh yeah because that would
cause it to list every classic file on

1276
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
cause it to list every classic file on
 

1277
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,630
cause it to list every classic file on
the file system

1278
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
the file system
 

1279
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,269
the file system
yeah i wonder although the card has gone

1280
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
yeah i wonder although the card has gone
 

1281
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,789
yeah i wonder although the card has gone
you know it might have been a bit

1282
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
you know it might have been a bit
 

1283
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,350
you know it might have been a bit
good very up a little bit yeah that's

1284
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
good very up a little bit yeah that's
 

1285
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,590
good very up a little bit yeah that's
possible but i'm not ready to suspect

1286
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
possible but i'm not ready to suspect
 

1287
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,789
possible but i'm not ready to suspect
the card yet

1288
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
the card yet
 

1289
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,950
the card yet
i think i think cyber's hit on this i

1290
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
i think i think cyber's hit on this i
 

1291
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,549
i think i think cyber's hit on this i
think that source of random data is

1292
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
think that source of random data is
 

1293
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,430
think that source of random data is
certainly

1294
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
certainly
 

1295
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,470
certainly
uh the first thing to try so i can try

1296
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480
uh the first thing to try so i can try
 

1297
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,110
uh the first thing to try so i can try
that

1298
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
that
 

1299
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,950
that
yeah please do doug i think that will i

1300
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
yeah please do doug i think that will i
 

1301
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,630
yeah please do doug i think that will i
think that'll solve it just see if you

1302
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
think that'll solve it just see if you
 

1303
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,669
think that'll solve it just see if you
can open another

1304
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
can open another
 

1305
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,630
can open another
terminal and uh and then do that fine

1306
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
terminal and uh and then do that fine
 

1307
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,149
terminal and uh and then do that fine
command and see if that will do it for

1308
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
command and see if that will do it for
 

1309
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,750
command and see if that will do it for
