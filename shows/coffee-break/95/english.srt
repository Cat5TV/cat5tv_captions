163
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,070
do you two have any suggestions about uh
making the bios recognize the um that's

164
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
making the bios recognize the um that's
 

165
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,949
making the bios recognize the um that's
right try updating your bios

166
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959

 

167
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,070

i did not it's a fairly new machine um

168
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
i did not it's a fairly new machine um
 

169
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,750
i did not it's a fairly new machine um
i don't know i think the bios is up to

170
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
i don't know i think the bios is up to
 

171
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,350
i don't know i think the bios is up to
date but you're right i could certainly

172
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
date but you're right i could certainly
 

173
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,589
date but you're right i could certainly
try that

174
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
try that
 

175
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,869
try that
um once you get in the box you could

176
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
um once you get in the box you could
 

177
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,750
um once you get in the box you could
also

178
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
also
 

179
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,789
also
check that the uh on additional drive is

there's a there's a setting for it it's
supposed to detect it automatically as

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
supposed to detect it automatically as
 

193
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,630
supposed to detect it automatically as
soon as it goes in

194
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
soon as it goes in
 

195
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,830
soon as it goes in
um but it just is not it's just not

196
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
um but it just is not it's just not

at all um even if the
 

213
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,390
at all um even if the
but i i need for the bios to see it so

214
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
but i i need for the bios to see it so
 

215
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,910
but i i need for the bios to see it so
that at least

216
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
that at least
 

217
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,070
that at least
it will have the opportunity to boot now

218
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
it will have the opportunity to boot now
 

219
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,949
it will have the opportunity to boot now
it does have a little m2 ssd inside it

220
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
it does have a little m2 ssd inside it
 

221
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,589
it does have a little m2 ssd inside it
right now you know the little card type

222
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
right now you know the little card type
 

223
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,710
right now you know the little card type
drive and it recognized that it knows

224
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
drive and it recognized that it knows
 

225
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,710
drive and it recognized that it knows
it's there obviously because that's how

226
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
it's there obviously because that's how
 

227
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,430
it's there obviously because that's how
that's how it came delivered um i'm

228
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
that's how it came delivered um i'm
 

229
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,390
that's how it came delivered um i'm
almost wondering

230
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
almost wondering
 

231
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,150
almost wondering
excuse me i'm almost wondering if i pull

232
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
excuse me i'm almost wondering if i pull
 

233
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,390
excuse me i'm almost wondering if i pull
it out if i pull that m2 drive out

234
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
it out if i pull that m2 drive out
 

235
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,710
it out if i pull that m2 drive out
whether that will um uh work any

236
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
whether that will um uh work any
 

237
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,070
whether that will um uh work any
any better if it'll force it to go look

238
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
any better if it'll force it to go look
 

239
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,590
any better if it'll force it to go look
at the um

240
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
at the um
 

241
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,110
at the um
i think i've had this uh problem uh

242
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
i think i've had this uh problem uh
 

243
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,230
i think i've had this uh problem uh
15 years ago on our system uh

244
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
15 years ago on our system uh
 

245
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,350
15 years ago on our system uh
back in the day when um five

246
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
back in the day when um five
 

247
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,990
back in the day when um five
or six gigabytes uh hard drive was still

248
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
or six gigabytes uh hard drive was still
 

249
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,469
or six gigabytes uh hard drive was still
uh

250
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
uh
 

251
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,749
uh
no big deal okay yeah

252
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
no big deal okay yeah
 

253
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,350
no big deal okay yeah
it was common back then we were fitting

254
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
it was common back then we were fitting
 

255
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,230
it was common back then we were fitting
a friend of mine i think it was fitting

256
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
a friend of mine i think it was fitting
 

257
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,629
a friend of mine i think it was fitting
uh

258
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
uh
 

259
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,469
uh
system was back at my place and we were

260
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
system was back at my place and we were
 

261
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,270
system was back at my place and we were
trying to install

262
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
trying to install
 

263
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,070
trying to install
a second hard drive the system wouldn't

264
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
a second hard drive the system wouldn't
 

265
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,870
a second hard drive the system wouldn't
see it so

266
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
see it so
 

267
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,830
see it so
um we deactivated it in bios and then

268
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
um we deactivated it in bios and then
 

269
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,830
um we deactivated it in bios and then
booted up just to see what would happen

270
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
booted up just to see what would happen
 

271
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,629
booted up just to see what would happen
uh it was

272
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
uh it was
 

273
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,230
uh it was
a linux was installed on that and on

274
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
a linux was installed on that and on
 

275
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,950
a linux was installed on that and on
that drive even even if the drive was

276
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
that drive even even if the drive was
 

277
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,790
that drive even even if the drive was
deactivated in bios linux

278
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
deactivated in bios linux
 

279
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,950
deactivated in bios linux
could still see it and could use it i

280
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
could still see it and could use it i
 

281
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,830
could still see it and could use it i
think that drive was

282
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:20,840
think that drive was
 

283
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,990
think that drive was
115 gigabytes

284
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
115 gigabytes
 

285
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,270
115 gigabytes
so the m2 has windows 10

286
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
so the m2 has windows 10
 

287
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,310
so the m2 has windows 10
um home on it which is what i'm using

288
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
um home on it which is what i'm using
 

289
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,790
um home on it which is what i'm using
now

290
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
now
 

291
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,909
now
sorry zombie and

292
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
sorry zombie and
 

293
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,350
sorry zombie and
i have to give you a hard time because

294
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
i have to give you a hard time because
 

295
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,230
i have to give you a hard time because
marshman did too so

296
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240

 

297
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,350

what you can try is if you have a

298
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
what you can try is if you have a
 

299
00:05:47,360 --> 00:06:01,749
what you can try is if you have a
linux mint uh a live cd or a

300
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759

 

301
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,710

can see both drives well for that the

302
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
can see both drives well for that the
 

303
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,990
can see both drives well for that the
only way that would work would

304
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
only way that would work would
 

305
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,070
only way that would work would
be if i could plug the the um

306
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
be if i could plug the the um
 

307
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,430
be if i could plug the the um
uh the cd player into the usb

308
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
uh the cd player into the usb
 

309
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,870
uh the cd player into the usb
port then it would have to boot off the

310
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
port then it would have to boot off the
 

311
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,430
port then it would have to boot off the
usb port right

312
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
usb port right
 

313
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:26,950
usb port right
or you could have a

314
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960

 

315
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,749

a usb flash drive and just boot from the

316
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
a usb flash drive and just boot from the
 

317
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,469
a usb flash drive and just boot from the
flash drive

318
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
flash drive
 

319
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,150
flash drive
well either way though it has to boot

320
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
well either way though it has to boot
 

321
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,309
well either way though it has to boot
off usb whether it boots off the

322
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
off usb whether it boots off the
 

323
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,309
off usb whether it boots off the
actual thing yeah and uh in most systems

324
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
actual thing yeah and uh in most systems
 

325
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,550
actual thing yeah and uh in most systems
there is um

326
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
there is um
 

327
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,150
there is um
you might have to activate something in

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
you might have to activate something in
 

329
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,990
you might have to activate something in
in the bios but uh

330
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
in the bios but uh
 

331
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,110
in the bios but uh
if there is a most biosystem you can

332
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
if there is a most biosystem you can
 

333
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,749
if there is a most biosystem you can
configure it used to be at the standard

334
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
configure it used to be at the standard
 

335

when you build it up there was a a few
 

339
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,589
when you build it up there was a a few
applause between

340

343
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,469
two and five seconds which told you you
press this to go to bios and press dash

to go and one of the keys i think if

346
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
to go and one of the keys i think if
 

347
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,909
to go and one of the keys i think if
12 on many systems um it will give you a

348
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
12 on many systems um it will give you a
 

349
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,870
12 on many systems um it will give you a
brute menu

350
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
brute menu
 

351
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,110
brute menu
over what device to boot from and usb is

over what device to boot from and usb is
 

353
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,550
over what device to boot from and usb is
one of those but

354
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
one of those but
 

355
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,749
one of those but
the usb flash drives they are

the usb flash drives they are
 

357
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,469
the usb flash drives they are
you have to select a hard drive because

358
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
you have to select a hard drive because
 

359
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:14,950
you have to select a hard drive because
they are

360
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
they are
 

361
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,230
they are
recognized yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll try

362

that
 

365
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,309
that
the only obstacle at that point could be

366
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
the only obstacle at that point could be
 

367
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,589
the only obstacle at that point could be
that if

368
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
that if
 

369
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,749
that if
there's a cubit is activated then it

370
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
there's a cubit is activated then it
 

371
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,629
there's a cubit is activated then it
might

372
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
might
 

373
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,870
might

well i tried to log into ubuntu and it
didn't recognize my login

490
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
didn't recognize my login
 

491
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,509
didn't recognize my login
although i had been in it before

492
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
although i had been in it before
 

493
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,870
although i had been in it before
successfully

494
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
successfully
 

495
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,030
successfully
suddenly it doesn't recognize my login

496
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
suddenly it doesn't recognize my login
 

497
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,389
suddenly it doesn't recognize my login
so i think the

498
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
so i think the
 

499
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,150
so i think the
uh sd card got corrupted oh no

500
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
uh sd card got corrupted oh no
 

501
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,069
uh sd card got corrupted oh no
so now i got to get a new sd card i

502
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
so now i got to get a new sd card i
 

503
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,870
so now i got to get a new sd card i
tried uh reflashing it

504
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
tried uh reflashing it
 

505
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,710
tried uh reflashing it
windows didn't recognize it after i

506
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
windows didn't recognize it after i
 

507
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,030
windows didn't recognize it after i
reflashed it

508
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
reflashed it
 

509
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,710
reflashed it
so i think i the sd card

510
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
so i think i the sd card
 

511
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,310
so i think i the sd card
got corrupted or the flash um

512
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
got corrupted or the flash um
 

513
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,750
got corrupted or the flash um
did you try this did you try fisk on the

514
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
did you try this did you try fisk on the
 

515
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,590
did you try this did you try fisk on the
uh on the sd card to see if you could um

516
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
uh on the sd card to see if you could um
 

517
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,430
uh on the sd card to see if you could um
yeah whatever think about that that's

518
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
yeah whatever think about that that's
 

519
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,790
yeah whatever think about that that's
the partitions and stuff

520
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
the partitions and stuff
 

521
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,710
the partitions and stuff
i think about fdisk in terms of hard

522
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
i think about fdisk in terms of hard
 

523
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,790
i think about fdisk in terms of hard
drives not

524
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
drives not
 

525
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,430
drives not
not uh portable media uh well they're

526
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
not uh portable media uh well they're
 

527
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,990
not uh portable media uh well they're
still

528
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
still
 

529
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,829
still
as as silver's already mentioned they're

530
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
as as silver's already mentioned they're
 

531
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,670
as as silver's already mentioned they're
still drives yeah yeah

532
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
still drives yeah yeah
 

533
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,430
still drives yeah yeah
they're still looked at as drives i

534
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
they're still looked at as drives i
 

535
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,870
they're still looked at as drives i
don't think they look at i don't think

536
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
don't think they look at i don't think
 

537
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,350
don't think they look at i don't think
they

538
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
they
 

539
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,190
they
emulate a floppy disk i think they're

540
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
emulate a floppy disk i think they're
 

541
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,190
emulate a floppy disk i think they're
more likely to emulate a hard disk so

542
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
more likely to emulate a hard disk so
 

543
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,949
more likely to emulate a hard disk so
but i think in any case i think they

544
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
but i think in any case i think they
 

545
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,030
but i think in any case i think they
would have

546
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
would have
 

547
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,509
would have
they will always show up in lsblq

548
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
they will always show up in lsblq
 

549
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,949
they will always show up in lsblq
and command i already threw out the

550
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
and command i already threw out the
 

551
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,670
and command i already threw out the
list block i already threw out the sd

552
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
list block i already threw out the sd
 

553
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,870
list block i already threw out the sd
card so

554
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
card so
 

555
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,590
card so
oh i don't know in that case yeah i'll

556
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
oh i don't know in that case yeah i'll
 

557
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,550
oh i don't know in that case yeah i'll
just buy a new one

558
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
just buy a new one
 

559
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,310
just buy a new one
well i hope you destroyed it physically

560
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
well i hope you destroyed it physically
 

561
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,670
well i hope you destroyed it physically
destroyed it you didn't just throw it in

562
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
destroyed it you didn't just throw it in
 

563
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,269
destroyed it you didn't just throw it in
the garbage did you

564
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
the garbage did you
 

565
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,870
the garbage did you
well there's nothing on it other than an

566
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
well there's nothing on it other than an
 

567
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,269
well there's nothing on it other than an
unreadable os

568
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
unreadable os
 

569
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,949
unreadable os
i don't know you'd be surprised at what

570
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
i don't know you'd be surprised at what
 

571
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,389
i don't know you'd be surprised at what
hackers can

572
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
hackers can
 

573
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,790
hackers can
can can retrieve well i had but there's

574
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
can can retrieve well i had but there's
 

575
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,069
can can retrieve well i had but there's
nothing personal

576
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
nothing personal
 

577
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,389
nothing personal
i reformatted it a couple of times

578
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
i reformatted it a couple of times
 

579
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,670
i reformatted it a couple of times
before i tried reflashing the uh okay os

580
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
before i tried reflashing the uh okay os
 

581
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,790
before i tried reflashing the uh okay os
so i don't think there's anything

582
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
so i don't think there's anything
 

583
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,670
so i don't think there's anything
readable on there

584
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
readable on there
 

585
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,550
readable on there
okay all right good the other thing you

586
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
okay all right good the other thing you
 

587
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,990
okay all right good the other thing you
could have tried as well there's a

588
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
could have tried as well there's a
 

589
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,790
could have tried as well there's a
utility

590
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
utility
 

591
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,150
utility
that lets you physically check the size

592
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
that lets you physically check the size
 

593
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,269
that lets you physically check the size
of the drive by

594
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
of the drive by
 

595
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,949
of the drive by
writing to it until it gets to the end

596
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
writing to it until it gets to the end
 

597
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,190
writing to it until it gets to the end
of the drive i forget the name of it

598
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
of the drive i forget the name of it
 

599
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,310
of the drive i forget the name of it
and i think it's a linux utility now

600
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
and i think it's a linux utility now
 

601
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,230
and i think it's a linux utility now
that that will test the size of the

602
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
that that will test the size of the
 

603
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,629
that that will test the size of the
drive to see if it really truly is

604
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
drive to see if it really truly is
 

605
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,990
drive to see if it really truly is
check one of robbie's old um uh cat5 tv

606
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
check one of robbie's old um uh cat5 tv
 

607
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,230

episodes because he talks about those

608
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
episodes because he talks about those
 

609
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,829
episodes because he talks about those
um and amazon you know a um

610
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
um and amazon you know a um
 

611
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,870
um and amazon you know a um
an sd card that you got from amazon

612
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
an sd card that you got from amazon
 

613
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,949
an sd card that you got from amazon
that says it's 16 gig or something but

614
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
that says it's 16 gig or something but
 

615
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,870
that says it's 16 gig or something but
it turns out only to before giggle so

616
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
it turns out only to before giggle so
 

617
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,710
it turns out only to before giggle so
when you actually test it

618
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
when you actually test it
 

619
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,430
when you actually test it
um ebay is good for that too they're

620
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
um ebay is good for that too they're
 

621
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,470
um ebay is good for that too they're
right oh there's those

622
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
right oh there's those
 

623
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,670
right oh there's those
fake sd cards no this i bought this from

624
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
fake sd cards no this i bought this from
 

625
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,629
fake sd cards no this i bought this from
walmart it said it was a 32 gig drive

626
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
walmart it said it was a 32 gig drive
 

627
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,790
walmart it said it was a 32 gig drive
and um when i tried to format it

628
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
and um when i tried to format it
 

629
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,990
and um when i tried to format it
it recognized it as 29 point something

630
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
it recognized it as 29 point something
 

631
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,790
it recognized it as 29 point something
gigabytes so that's about right because

632
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
gigabytes so that's about right because
 

633
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,190
gigabytes so that's about right because
you always lose some space in formatting

634
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
you always lose some space in formatting
 

635
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,110
you always lose some space in formatting
right because it has a little bit of an

636
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
right because it has a little bit of an
 

637
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,710
right because it has a little bit of an
os of its own

638
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
os of its own
 

639
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,710
os of its own
there's some well but yeah it's just the

640
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
there's some well but yeah it's just the
 

641
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,949
there's some well but yeah it's just the
amount of space used by the formatting

642
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
amount of space used by the formatting
 

643
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,829
amount of space used by the formatting
procedure

644
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
procedure
 

645
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,230
procedure
right yeah remember

646
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240

 

647
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,590

floppies were still uh uh widely used

648
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
floppies were still uh uh widely used
 

649
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,949
floppies were still uh uh widely used

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,389
i'm here to tell you it
it has a binky little main board there

816
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
it has a binky little main board there
 

817
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,189
it has a binky little main board there
you go pinky little main board

818
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
you go pinky little main board
 

819
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,310
you go pinky little main board
but mostly air in inside this thing um

820
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
but mostly air in inside this thing um
 

821
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,150
but mostly air in inside this thing um
there's a big little main board and some

822
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
there's a big little main board and some
 

823
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,749
there's a big little main board and some
sub boards and just ribbon cables that

824
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
sub boards and just ribbon cables that
 

825
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,829
sub boards and just ribbon cables that
connect them all together so it's

826
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
connect them all together so it's
 

827
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,310
connect them all together so it's
very surprising how how small the

828
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
very surprising how how small the
 

829
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,470
very surprising how how small the
technology has gotten these days

830
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
technology has gotten these days
 

831
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,509
technology has gotten these days
but it still won't recognize my um

832
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
but it still won't recognize my um
 

833
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,069
but it still won't recognize my um
my my setter drive so i gotta i gotta

834
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
my my setter drive so i gotta i gotta
 

835
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,269
my my setter drive so i gotta i gotta
figure something out with that

836
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
figure something out with that
 

837
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,110
figure something out with that
well another thing that you can try that

838
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
well another thing that you can try that
 

839
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,790
well another thing that you can try that
i just uh thought of you know that you

840
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
i just uh thought of you know that you
 

841
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,230
i just uh thought of you know that you
mentioned you have another

842
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
mentioned you have another
 

843
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,069
mentioned you have another
oh i'm open to all kinds whatever ideas

844
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
oh i'm open to all kinds whatever ideas
 

845
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,509
oh i'm open to all kinds whatever ideas
you've got i'm open

846
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
you've got i'm open
 

847
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,710
you've got i'm open
take the existing uh drive and uh plug

848
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
take the existing uh drive and uh plug
 

849
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,669
take the existing uh drive and uh plug
it into the

850
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
it into the
 

851
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,189
it into the
order just to see if that works

852
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
order just to see if that works
 

853
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,669
order just to see if that works
on that connection provided it is the

854
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
on that connection provided it is the
 

855
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,870
on that connection provided it is the
same same type of drive

856
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
same same type of drive
 

857
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,990
same same type of drive
so the existing drive is

858
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
so the existing drive is
 

859
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,429
so the existing drive is
a um is an m2 card

860
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
a um is an m2 card
 

861
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,789
a um is an m2 card
ah not a sata drive there's only room

862
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
ah not a sata drive there's only room
 

863
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,829
ah not a sata drive there's only room
for one starter driving here

864
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
for one starter driving here
 

865
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,950
for one starter driving here
um if i take that if i take the

866
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
um if i take that if i take the
 

867
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,350
um if i take that if i take the
ssd and plug it into an adapter

868
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
ssd and plug it into an adapter
 

869
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,669
ssd and plug it into an adapter
that's a sat adapter on one end and a

870
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
that's a sat adapter on one end and a
 

871

at all
so windows and this pc will recognize

880
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
so windows and this pc will recognize
 

881
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,789
so windows and this pc will recognize

this laptop will recognize
 

883
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,150
this laptop will recognize
the um the the the sata drive

884
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
the um the the the sata drive
 

885
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,190
the um the the the sata drive

it it works the sata drive works
 

887
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,909
it it works the sata drive works
it just won't work through that cable to

888

it just won't work through that cable to
 

889
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,950
it just won't work through that cable to
the main board

890
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
the main board
 

891
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,350
the main board
and i don't know if the cable's bad or

892
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
and i don't know if the cable's bad or
 

893

or what the deal is
 

895
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,909
or what the deal is
is the cable part of the computer or can

896
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
is the cable part of the computer or can
 

897
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,990
is the cable part of the computer or can
you replace it

898
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
you replace it
 

899
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,830
you replace it
i can replace it i'd have to buy another

900
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
i can replace it i'd have to buy another
 

901
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,909
i can replace it i'd have to buy another
one from from the manufacturer yeah

i definitely try replacing that cable
 

905
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,230
i definitely try replacing that cable
yeah yeah yeah well it came with the

906
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
yeah yeah yeah well it came with the
 

907
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,390
yeah yeah yeah well it came with the
machine it was already there it was all

908
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
machine it was already there it was all
 

909
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,430
machine it was already there it was all
ready to plug in

910
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
ready to plug in
 

911
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,549
ready to plug in
so yeah so i agree with you that would

912
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
so yeah so i agree with you that would
 

913
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,990
so yeah so i agree with you that would
be the first step would be to try

914
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
be the first step would be to try
 

915
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,190
be the first step would be to try
replacing that

916
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
replacing that
 

917
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,870
replacing that
that cable and see what happens that's

918
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
that cable and see what happens that's
 

919
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,710
that cable and see what happens that's
what i would do and if that doesn't work

920
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
what i would do and if that doesn't work
 

921
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,750
what i would do and if that doesn't work
send it back and say all right fix it

922
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
send it back and say all right fix it
 

923
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,669
send it back and say all right fix it
what brand is the computer it's it's a

924
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
what brand is the computer it's it's a
 

925
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,870
what brand is the computer it's it's a
bill

926
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
bill
 

927
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,070
bill
okay well they're usually pretty good i

928
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
okay well they're usually pretty good i
 

929
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,310
okay well they're usually pretty good i
i suspected so as well i've had good

930
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
i suspected so as well i've had good
 

931
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,590
i suspected so as well i've had good
luck with dell that's the first time

932
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
luck with dell that's the first time
 

933
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,870
luck with dell that's the first time
i've had a problem with it

934
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
i've had a problem with it
 

935
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,549
i've had a problem with it
and all i can think of is that there's

936
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
and all i can think of is that there's
 

937
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,390
and all i can think of is that there's
some misconfiguration

938
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
some misconfiguration
 

939
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,710
some misconfiguration
um but one of the things i do want to

940
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
um but one of the things i do want to
 

941
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,029
um but one of the things i do want to
try is to

942
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
try is to
 

943
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,710
try is to
probably take out the coin battery to

944
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
probably take out the coin battery to
 

945
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,270
probably take out the coin battery to
reset the bios completely to fresh

946
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
reset the bios completely to fresh
 

947
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,870
reset the bios completely to fresh
to a fresh bios yeah um then

948
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
to a fresh bios yeah um then
 

949
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,789
to a fresh bios yeah um then
take out the m2 uh the little

950
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
take out the m2 uh the little
 

951
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,190
take out the m2 uh the little
card yeah and then put that and then put

952
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
card yeah and then put that and then put
 

953
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,230
card yeah and then put that and then put
the sata inside

954
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
the sata inside
 

955
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,630
the sata inside
yeah make that the only os right right

956
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
yeah make that the only os right right
 

957
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,390
yeah make that the only os right right
make it the only drive that it can boot

958
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
make it the only drive that it can boot
 

959
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,230
make it the only drive that it can boot
from see if it recognizes that yeah and

960
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
from see if it recognizes that yeah and
 

961
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,549
from see if it recognizes that yeah and
dell is usually easy to work on too

962
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
dell is usually easy to work on too
 

963
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,150
dell is usually easy to work on too
yeah they are that's why some of the

964
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
yeah they are that's why some of the
 

965
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,990
yeah they are that's why some of the
easiest computers i've worked on

966
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
easiest computers i've worked on
 

967
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,590
easiest computers i've worked on
yeah yeah yep yep as i say i've had good

968
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
yeah yeah yep yep as i say i've had good
 

969
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,110
yeah yeah yep yep as i say i've had good
luck with them so

970
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
luck with them so
 

971
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,029
luck with them so
um so it was rather disappointing to

972
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
um so it was rather disappointing to
 

973
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,750
um so it was rather disappointing to
to not be able to boot linux on it so

974
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760

okay

1070
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
okay
 

1071
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,230
okay
okay but it's it's it's your hardware

1072
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
okay but it's it's it's your hardware
 

1073
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,950
okay but it's it's it's your hardware
yeah okay well that's better than using

1074
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
yeah okay well that's better than using
 

1075
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,630
yeah okay well that's better than using
someone else's computer anyway

1076
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
someone else's computer anyway
 

1077
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,070
someone else's computer anyway
i guess that was the point i was trying

1078
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
i guess that was the point i was trying
 

1079
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,310
i guess that was the point i was trying
to make i wanted to make sure it was it

1080
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
to make i wanted to make sure it was it
 

1081
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,870
to make i wanted to make sure it was it
was

was
 

1083
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,549
was
not someone else's computer that you

1084
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
not someone else's computer that you
 

1085
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,390
not someone else's computer that you
were actually dealing with

1086
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
were actually dealing with
 

1087
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,430
were actually dealing with
it used to be uh his computer but we

1088
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
it used to be uh his computer but we
 

1089
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,230
it used to be uh his computer but we
shared on the monthly bill and now we uh

1090
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
shared on the monthly bill and now we uh
 

1091
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,070
shared on the monthly bill and now we uh
five years ago we uh upgraded to uh

1092
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
five years ago we uh upgraded to uh
 

1093
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,390
five years ago we uh upgraded to uh
a faster server and and now uh

1094
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
a faster server and and now uh
 

1095
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,669
a faster server and and now uh
we only uh the half each and i believe

1096
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
we only uh the half each and i believe
 

1097
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,669
we only uh the half each and i believe
and i pay all the bills so

1098
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
and i pay all the bills so
 

1099
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,350
and i pay all the bills so
oh okay wow getting up in the world

1100
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
oh okay wow getting up in the world
 

1101
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,549
oh okay wow getting up in the world
yeah there you go there you go so it's

1102
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
yeah there you go there you go so it's
 

1103
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,390
yeah there you go there you go so it's
in a data center so you have

1104
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
in a data center so you have
 

1105
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,789
in a data center so you have
easy access to to the internet is that

1106
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
easy access to to the internet is that
 

1107
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,470
easy access to to the internet is that
why

1108
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
why
 

1109
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,830
why
or is it just it's managed better than
