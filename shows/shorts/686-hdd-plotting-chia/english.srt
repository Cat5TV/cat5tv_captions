i wanted to show you how to plot because
 

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,030
i wanted to show you how to plot because
that is the most important thing

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
that is the most important thing

to get you going with chia now we talk
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,589
to get you going with chia now we talk
about using nvmes why

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
well you've seen videos that say oh you
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,310
well you've seen videos that say oh you
can plot on a standard spinning drive

12
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
can plot on a standard spinning drive
 

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,109
can plot on a standard spinning drive
don't worry about it don't get an nvme

14
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
don't worry about it don't get an nvme
 

15
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,470
don't worry about it don't get an nvme
ignore those people

16
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
ignore those people
 

17
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,390
ignore those people
because i'm not telling you it's

18
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
because i'm not telling you it's
 

19
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,670
because i'm not telling you it's
impossible

20

you can take your bicycle on the highway

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
you can take your bicycle on the highway
 

23
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,509
you can take your bicycle on the highway
but you're not going to do 120

24
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
but you're not going to do 120
 

25

great technology don't get sidetracked

28
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
great technology don't get sidetracked
 

29
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,790
great technology don't get sidetracked
by people saying oh you can do it

30
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
by people saying oh you can do it

and and you're you're gonna want nvme

36
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
and and you're you're gonna want nvme
 

37
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,430

because it is significantly faster at

thing is you need to get your drives

42
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
thing is you need to get your drives
 

43
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,750
thing is you need to get your drives
plotted as

44
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
plotted as
 

45
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,069
plotted as
quickly as possible otherwise you've got

46
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
quickly as possible otherwise you've got
 

47
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,350
quickly as possible otherwise you've got
a couple of plots

48
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
a couple of plots
 

49
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,029
a couple of plots
and a whole bunch of empty space and

50
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
and a whole bunch of empty space and
 

51
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,869
and a whole bunch of empty space and
that empty space is doing nothing for

52
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
that empty space is doing nothing for
 

53
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,670
that empty space is doing nothing for
you it will do

54
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
you it will do
 

55
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,879
you it will do
nothing for you until it's plotted
