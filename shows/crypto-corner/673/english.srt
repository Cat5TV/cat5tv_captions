00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
because we're getting old
 

169
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,030
because we're getting old
world people into our industry but not

170
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
world people into our industry but not
 

171
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,670
world people into our industry but not
so much

172
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
so much
 

173
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,830
so much
the beauty of this year is that we've

174
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
the beauty of this year is that we've
 

175
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,830
the beauty of this year is that we've
got also statistics that are coming from

176
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
got also statistics that are coming from
 

177
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,190
got also statistics that are coming from
unchained data so

178
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
unchained data so
 

179
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,830
unchained data so
for example how many people are taking

180
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
for example how many people are taking
 

181
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,430
for example how many people are taking
their coins off exchanges

182
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
their coins off exchanges
 

183
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,949
their coins off exchanges
why is it important because if people

184
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
why is it important because if people
 

185
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,790
why is it important because if people
are taking the coins off exchanges it

186
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
are taking the coins off exchanges it
 

187
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,350
are taking the coins off exchanges it
means

188
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
means
 

189
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,990
means
they don't want to sell it if they are

190
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
they don't want to sell it if they are
 

191
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,190
they don't want to sell it if they are
on the other hand

192
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
on the other hand
 

193
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,869
on the other hand
returning coins onto the exchanges

194
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
returning coins onto the exchanges
 

195
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,390
returning coins onto the exchanges
that's usually a sign that they're about

196
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
that's usually a sign that they're about
 

197
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,670
that's usually a sign that they're about
to sell something

198
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
to sell something
 

199
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,430
to sell something
so those statistics there are few around

200
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
so those statistics there are few around
 

201
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,949
so those statistics there are few around
and i just want to show you a few that

202
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
and i just want to show you a few that
 

203
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,309
and i just want to show you a few that
are really

204
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
are really
 

205
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,910
are really
really compelling and the website is

206
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
really compelling and the website is
 

207
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,390
really compelling and the website is
look into bitcoin.com

208
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
look into bitcoin.com
 

209
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,990
look into bitcoin.com
so the first one we're going to look to

210
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
so the first one we're going to look to
 

211
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,550
so the first one we're going to look to
into mvrv

212
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
into mvrv
 

213
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,670
into mvrv
so market value and

214
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
so market value and
 

215
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,270
so market value and
realized value and it takes a second to

216
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
realized value and it takes a second to
 

217
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,910
realized value and it takes a second to
load

218
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
load
 

219
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,149
load
but i'm sure we'll see that in a second

220
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
but i'm sure we'll see that in a second
 

221
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,949
but i'm sure we'll see that in a second
here we go

222
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
here we go
 

223
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,229
here we go
so the this is the the chart of the of

224
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
so the this is the the chart of the of
 

225
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,589
so the this is the the chart of the of
this uh this indicator and the blue line

226
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
this uh this indicator and the blue line
 

227
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,630
this uh this indicator and the blue line
is the

228
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
is the
 

229
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,110
is the
price of bitcoin and as you can see when

230
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
price of bitcoin and as you can see when
 

231
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,229
price of bitcoin and as you can see when
this thing peaked

232
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
this thing peaked
 

233
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,470
this thing peaked
the price price of bitcoin also peaked

234
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
the price price of bitcoin also peaked
 

235
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,670
the price price of bitcoin also peaked
when this was

236
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
when this was
 

237
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,990
when this was
the price was low the indicator was low

238
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
the price was low the indicator was low
 

239
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,229
the price was low the indicator was low
so it's a pretty good indicator

240
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
so it's a pretty good indicator
 

241
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,789
so it's a pretty good indicator
to tell you when to buy and when to sell

242
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
to tell you when to buy and when to sell
 

243
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,470
to tell you when to buy and when to sell
at the moment as you can see it's here

244
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
at the moment as you can see it's here
 

245
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,670
at the moment as you can see it's here
in the middle ground

246
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
in the middle ground
 

247
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,349
in the middle ground
so it's not in the red it's not in the

248
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
so it's not in the red it's not in the
 

249
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,430
so it's not in the red it's not in the
green area and there are few others like

250
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
green area and there are few others like
 

251
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,390
green area and there are few others like
those around

252
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
those around
 

253
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,950
those around
so they are holding ratio and you can

254
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
so they are holding ratio and you can
 

255
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,390
so they are holding ratio and you can
this website is really good

256
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
this website is really good
 

257
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,310
this website is really good
uh because it also explains to you in

258
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
uh because it also explains to you in
 

259
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,430
uh because it also explains to you in
detail

260
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
detail
 

261
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,469
detail
uh how what this indicator is and how to

262
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
uh how what this indicator is and how to
 

263
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,270
uh how what this indicator is and how to
read it

264
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
read it
 

265
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,870
read it
and again here this hour holder ratio is

266
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
and again here this hour holder ratio is
 

267
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,150
and again here this hour holder ratio is
something completely different to what

268
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
something completely different to what
 

269
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,590
something completely different to what
we saw before

270
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
we saw before
 

271
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,310
we saw before
but here price high indicator high price

272
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
but here price high indicator high price
 

273
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,310
but here price high indicator high price
high indicator high price low indicator

274
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
high indicator high price low indicator
 

275
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,350
high indicator high price low indicator
low

276
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
low
 

277
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,950
low
so a pretty good correlation between

278
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
so a pretty good correlation between
 

279
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,590
so a pretty good correlation between
when to buy and when to sell or here's

280
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
when to buy and when to sell or here's
 

281
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,310
when to buy and when to sell or here's
the next one

282
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
the next one
 

283
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,749
the next one
the new unrealized profit and loss ratio

284
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
the new unrealized profit and loss ratio
 

285
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,670
the new unrealized profit and loss ratio
here when things go into the red it

286
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
here when things go into the red it
 

287
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,189
here when things go into the red it
means it's danger zone

288
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
means it's danger zone
 

289
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,870
means it's danger zone
at the moment it's already in red but i

290
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
at the moment it's already in red but i
 

291
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,430
at the moment it's already in red but i
would say that those real peaks here

292
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
would say that those real peaks here
 

293
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,870
would say that those real peaks here
is about 70 80 percent that's

294
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
is about 70 80 percent that's
 

295
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,270
is about 70 80 percent that's
uh when the danger zone is here and

296
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
uh when the danger zone is here and
 

297
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,310
uh when the danger zone is here and
again when the

298
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
again when the
 

299
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,029
again when the
price peaked this indicator peak yeah so

300
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
price peaked this indicator peak yeah so
 

301
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,749
price peaked this indicator peak yeah so
you see

302
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
you see
 

303
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,909
you see
that there are a few of those indicators

304
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
that there are a few of those indicators
 

305
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,350
that there are a few of those indicators
that really make sense

306
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
that really make sense
 

307
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,390
that really make sense
uh to follow and to study and that will

308
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
uh to follow and to study and that will
 

309
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,830
uh to follow and to study and that will
give you the confidence whether you're

310
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
give you the confidence whether you're
 

311
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,070
give you the confidence whether you're
investing in the right thing or not

312
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
investing in the right thing or not
 

313
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,350
investing in the right thing or not
so yeah that's it for me uh today

trading

320
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,270
have got some investment because that
would be

326
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
