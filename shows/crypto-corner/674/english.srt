254
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
cryptocurrencies this is the way to do
 

255
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,190
cryptocurrencies this is the way to do
that

256
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
that
 

257
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,030
that
now phase one is a little bit more

258
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
now phase one is a little bit more
 

259
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,710
now phase one is a little bit more
complex so you go

260
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
complex so you go
 

261
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,789
complex so you go
same exchanges but you add also binance

262
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
same exchanges but you add also binance
 

263
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,910
same exchanges but you add also binance
in the u.s binance to

264
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
in the u.s binance to
 

265
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,229
in the u.s binance to
us because they don't binance.com is not

266
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
us because they don't binance.com is not
 

267
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,229
us because they don't binance.com is not
allowing us customers

268
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
allowing us customers
 

269
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,229
allowing us customers
but they created binance.yes is the

270
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
but they created binance.yes is the
 

271
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,910
but they created binance.yes is the
environment so that's

272
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
environment so that's
 

273
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,550
environment so that's
binance and then you take the top 10

274
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
binance and then you take the top 10
 

275
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,110
binance and then you take the top 10
clients

276
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
clients
 

277
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,550
clients

279
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,150
and but you need to do some research
first because if you don't do research

280
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
first because if you don't do research
 

281
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,590
first because if you don't do research
and you invest in the coin

282
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
and you invest in the coin
 

283
