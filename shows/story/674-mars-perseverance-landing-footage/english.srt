333
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,309
means and why
it's called that and and what we have to

334
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
it's called that and and what we have to
 

335
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,390
it's called that and and what we have to
understand and remember is that mars is

336
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
understand and remember is that mars is
 

337
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,430
understand and remember is that mars is
really far away

338
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
really far away
 

339
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,710
really far away
yeah really far away so when

340
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
yeah really far away so when
 

341
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,510
yeah really far away so when
the when the rover is approaching mars

342
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
the when the rover is approaching mars
 

343
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,230
the when the rover is approaching mars
and

344
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
and
 

345
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,430
and
is about to enter the atmosphere

346
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
is about to enter the atmosphere
 

347
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,189
is about to enter the atmosphere
what nasa is seeing on their feed

348
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
what nasa is seeing on their feed
 

349
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,469
what nasa is seeing on their feed
is between about 7 to 11 minutes

350
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
is between about 7 to 11 minutes
 

351
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,189
is between about 7 to 11 minutes
delayed right so as it hits that

00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
delayed right so as it hits that
 

353
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,909

the landing that it needs to do
 

359
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,550
the landing that it needs to do
that they've programmed using tons of

360
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
that they've programmed using tons of
 

361
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,550
that they've programmed using tons of
simulations and and

362
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
simulations and and
 

363
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,590
simulations and and
data and mathematics and and all of this

364
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
data and mathematics and and all of this
 

365
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,070

stuff

366
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
stuff
 

367
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,710
stuff
is now taking place and they know this

368
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
is now taking place and they know this
 

369
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,629
is now taking place and they know this
is happening right now but we're not

370
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
is happening right now but we're not
 

371
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,469
is happening right now but we're not
going to see it

372
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
going to see it
 

373
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,510
going to see it
for another seven minutes right so you

374
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
for another seven minutes right so you
 

375
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,430
for another seven minutes right so you
you don't know if it actually works you

376
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
you don't know if it actually works you
 

377
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,950
you don't know if it actually works you
want to speak about

378
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
want to speak about
 

379
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,710
want to speak about
sitting on the edge of your seat after

380
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
sitting on the edge of your seat after
 

381
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,230
sitting on the edge of your seat after
years and years of

382
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
years and years of
 

383
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,189
years and years of
dreaming and planning and and building

384
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
dreaming and planning and and building
 

385
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,589
dreaming and planning and and building
and

386
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
and
 

387
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,430
and
spending yes oh boy so when that thing

388
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
spending yes oh boy so when that thing
 

389
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,230
spending yes oh boy so when that thing
touched down

390
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
touched down
 

391
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,469
touched down
and they got that feedback i mean seven

392
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
and they got that feedback i mean seven
 

393
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,589
and they got that feedback i mean seven
minutes after it actually happened

394
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
minutes after it actually happened
 

395
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,029
minutes after it actually happened
wow yeah what a relief and the fact that

396
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
wow yeah what a relief and the fact that
 

397
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,029
wow yeah what a relief and the fact that
um it was such a high speed

398
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
um it was such a high speed
 

399
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,390
um it was such a high speed
that it was entering 19 000 kilometers

400
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
that it was entering 19 000 kilometers
 

401
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,029
that it was entering 19 000 kilometers
an hour

402
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
an hour
 

403
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,670
an hour
yeah and that it slows it down and it

404
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
yeah and that it slows it down and it
 

405
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,309
yeah and that it slows it down and it
works so perfectly to the point that

406
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
works so perfectly to the point that
 

407
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,950
works so perfectly to the point that
the platform is hovering yeah like it

408
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
the platform is hovering yeah like it
 

409
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,510
the platform is hovering yeah like it
slows to 2.6 kilometers an hour which

410
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
slows to 2.6 kilometers an hour which
 

411
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,950
slows to 2.6 kilometers an hour which
i think is like walking speed and then

412
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
i think is like walking speed and then
 

413
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,270
i think is like walking speed and then
it's just lower than that yeah yeah i

414
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
it's just lower than that yeah yeah i
 

415
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,230
it's just lower than that yeah yeah i
guess

416
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
guess
 

417
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,350
guess
and then it just hovers well yeah okay

418
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
and then it just hovers well yeah okay
 

419
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,390
and then it just hovers well yeah okay
14 kilometers an hour

420
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
14 kilometers an hour
 

421
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,589
14 kilometers an hour
clock me okay i will you've seen me run

422
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
clock me okay i will you've seen me run
 

423
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,790
clock me okay i will you've seen me run
into the bridge when something's not

424
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
into the bridge when something's not
 

425
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,909
into the bridge when something's not
working oh yeah

426
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
working oh yeah
 

427
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,189
working oh yeah
that's true that's pretty fast like it's

428
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
that's true that's pretty fast like it's
 

429
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,150
that's true that's pretty fast like it's
it's using those

430
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
it's using those
 

431
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,830
it's using those
thrusters to kind of float then it

432
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
thrusters to kind of float then it
 

433
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,670
thrusters to kind of float then it
releases through cables

434
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
releases through cables
 

435
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,990
releases through cables
like that's some precision engineering

436
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
like that's some precision engineering
 

437
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,189
like that's some precision engineering
and play and why would they

438
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
and play and why would they
 

439
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,790
and play and why would they
why on earth are they you know because

440
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
why on earth are they you know because
 

441
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,309
why on earth are they you know because
it looks exceptional because it's so

442
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
it looks exceptional because it's so
 

443
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,869
it looks exceptional because it's so
cool

444
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
cool
 

445
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,790
cool
no because if the rover were to come

446
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
no because if the rover were to come
 

447
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,990
no because if the rover were to come
down

448
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
down
 

449
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,430
down
it's going to be top heavy because this

450
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
it's going to be top heavy because this
 

451
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,110
it's going to be top heavy because this
thing has flown through space to get

452
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
thing has flown through space to get
 

453
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,510
thing has flown through space to get
there

454
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
there
 

455
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,790
there
right so the fear is is that as it hits

456
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
right so the fear is is that as it hits
 

457
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,350
right so the fear is is that as it hits
the the martian surface it could flip

458
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
the the martian surface it could flip
 

459
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,830
the the martian surface it could flip
over

460
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
over
 

461
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,390
over
yeah and then we're done yep so by

462
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
yeah and then we're done yep so by
 

463
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,909
yeah and then we're done yep so by
building it this way

464
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
building it this way
 

465
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,670
building it this way
hovering from a platform and then

466
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
hovering from a platform and then
 

467
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,670
hovering from a platform and then
lowering it down safely

468
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
lowering it down safely
 

469
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,950
lowering it down safely
they've basically completely negated the

470
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
they've basically completely negated the
 

471
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,990
they've basically completely negated the
the fear

472
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
the fear
 

473
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,790
the fear
or the risk of it landing on its head

474
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
or the risk of it landing on its head
 

475
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,550
or the risk of it landing on its head
yeah and flipping over when it hits that

476
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
yeah and flipping over when it hits that
 

477
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,029
yeah and flipping over when it hits that
surface at whatever speed it hits

478
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
surface at whatever speed it hits
 

479
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,670
surface at whatever speed it hits
yeah or even things like like breaking

480
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
yeah or even things like like breaking
 

481
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,870
yeah or even things like like breaking
the wheels off or

482
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
the wheels off or
 

483
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,709
the wheels off or
you know oh yeah then you're choking

484
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
you know oh yeah then you're choking
 

485
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,990
you know oh yeah then you're choking
yeah so it's a

486
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
yeah so it's a
 

487
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,470
yeah so it's a
very very controlled descent to the

488
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
very very controlled descent to the
 

489
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,470
very very controlled descent to the
point where okay boom we're six meters

490
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
point where okay boom we're six meters
 

491
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,190
point where okay boom we're six meters
up

492
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
up
 

493
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,790
up
now we're gonna just lower it down

494
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
now we're gonna just lower it down
 

495
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,310
now we're gonna just lower it down
softly yeah

496
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
softly yeah
