335
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,710
3d printed steak
but what i was blown away by with this

336
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
but what i was blown away by with this
 

337

story is the fact that
 

339
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,110
story is the fact that
it looks like a steak it tastes like a

and so i mean time will tell i i would
 

349
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,189
and so i mean time will tell i i would
sign up to try it

350
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
sign up to try it
 

351
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,950
sign up to try it
absolutely i mean it's it's me i gotta

352
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
absolutely i mean it's it's me i gotta
 

353
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,870
absolutely i mean it's it's me i gotta
try i mean and they can create

354
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
try i mean and they can create
 

355
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,790
try i mean and they can create
i wonder what this is going to do to the

356
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
i wonder what this is going to do to the
 

357
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,710
i wonder what this is going to do to the
industry at large

358
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
industry at large
 

359
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,230
industry at large
because the immediate thought that comes

360
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
because the immediate thought that comes
 

361
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,469
because the immediate thought that comes
to mind is like wagyu

362
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
to mind is like wagyu
 

363
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,870
to mind is like wagyu
right beef right so if they can create

364
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
right beef right so if they can create
 

365
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,510
right beef right so if they can create
that

366
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
that
 

367
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,629
that
perfectly simulated marbling not

i'm using the phrase simulated but it's

372
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
i'm using the phrase simulated but it's
 

373
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,870
i'm using the phrase simulated but it's
not simulated no it's it's

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
not simulated no it's it's
 

375
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,590
not simulated no it's it's
real yeah it's but it's designed by

376
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
real yeah it's but it's designed by
 

377
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,870
real yeah it's but it's designed by
humans

based upon the how meat

380
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
based upon the how meat
 

381
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,390
based upon the how meat
what meat is what the chemical makeup

382
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
what meat is what the chemical makeup
 

383
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,150
what meat is what the chemical makeup
and an actual

384
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
and an actual
 

385
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,629
and an actual
makeup of meat is mm-hmm but the fact

386
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
makeup of meat is mm-hmm but the fact
 

387
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,790
makeup of meat is mm-hmm but the fact
that you can custom order

388
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
that you can custom order
 

389
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,990
that you can custom order
like that's what they want to get to is

390
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
like that's what they want to get to is
 

391
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,670
like that's what they want to get to is
custom ordering your steak so it's like

392
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
custom ordering your steak so it's like
 

393
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,749

that
 

411
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,110
that
maybe it's just branding for me that i

412
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
maybe it's just branding for me that i
 

413

maybe it's just branding for me that i
kind of went oh

414
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
kind of went oh
 

415
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,469
kind of went oh
is the fact that it was mitsubishi

416
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
is the fact that it was mitsubishi
 

417
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,589
is the fact that it was mitsubishi
they're the ones who are doing the

418
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
they're the ones who are doing the
 

419
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,870
they're the ones who are doing the
technology the printing end of things

420
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
technology the printing end of things
 

421
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,230
technology the printing end of things
and i was just like

422
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
and i was just like
 

423
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,589
and i was just like
so take it one step further and you

424
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
so take it one step further and you
 

425
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,350
so take it one step further and you
think about well that's weird that a car

426
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
think about well that's weird that a car
 

427
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,710
think about well that's weird that a car
company would be involved in this right

428
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
company would be involved in this right
 

429
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,029
company would be involved in this right
i am wondering if tesla might take

430
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
i am wondering if tesla might take
 

431
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,710
i am wondering if tesla might take
notice and by tesla

432
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
notice and by tesla
 

433
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,309
notice and by tesla
i mean i mean the ceo of tesla elon musk

434
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
i mean i mean the ceo of tesla elon musk
 

435
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,230
i mean i mean the ceo of tesla elon musk
and the reason i say that is because you

436
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
and the reason i say that is because you
 

437
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,510
and the reason i say that is because you
start to see

438
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
start to see
 

439
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,749
start to see
connections between his companies oh

440
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
connections between his companies oh
 

441
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,710
connections between his companies oh
sure absolutely you see

442
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
sure absolutely you see
 

443
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,950
sure absolutely you see
the boring company and tesla with its

444
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
the boring company and tesla with its
 

445
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,749
the boring company and tesla with its
batteries and

446
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
batteries and
 

447
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,990
batteries and
and solar cells and and the um

448
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
and solar cells and and the um
 

449
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,790
and solar cells and and the um
uh spacex obviously yeah like all of

450
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
uh spacex obviously yeah like all of
 

451
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,469
uh spacex obviously yeah like all of
these things come together for what

452
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
these things come together for what
 

453
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,189
these things come together for what
a mission to mars right so thinking of a

454
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
a mission to mars right so thinking of a
 

455
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,270
a mission to mars right so thinking of a
car company like tesla picking up on a

456
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
car company like tesla picking up on a
 

457
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,390
car company like tesla picking up on a
technology like this

458
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
technology like this
 

459
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,070
technology like this
imagine being able to 3d print your

460
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
imagine being able to 3d print your
 

461
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,749
imagine being able to 3d print your
meat right on mars well and mars is like

462
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
meat right on mars well and mars is like
 

463
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,670
meat right on mars well and mars is like
what a one-year journey

464
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
what a one-year journey
 

465
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,589
what a one-year journey
they say or i think tesla's made a

466
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
they say or i think tesla's made a
 

467
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,070
they say or i think tesla's made a
little bit faster now with their spacex

468
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
little bit faster now with their spacex
 

469
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,070
little bit faster now with their spacex
but you know you've got that long

470
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
but you know you've got that long
 

471
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,589
but you know you've got that long
journey you can only have so much food

472
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
journey you can only have so much food
 

473
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,469
journey you can only have so much food
on board

474
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
on board
 

475
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,909
on board
but think about the fact that if you

476
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
but think about the fact that if you
 

477
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,749
but think about the fact that if you
could now print

478
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
could now print
 

479
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,950
could now print
your protein for astronauts yes

480
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
your protein for astronauts yes
 

481
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,469
your protein for astronauts yes
yeah all you have to do is have a diet

482
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
yeah all you have to do is have a diet
 

483
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,909
yeah all you have to do is have a diet
yeah balanced diet you can have a

484
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
yeah balanced diet you can have a
 

485
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,589
yeah balanced diet you can have a
cultured factory

486
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
cultured factory
 

487
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,150
cultured factory
so to speak that reduces so much weight

488
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
so to speak that reduces so much weight
 

489
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,309
so to speak that reduces so much weight
because you don't need all that extra

490
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
because you don't need all that extra
 

491
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,749
because you don't need all that extra
dehydrated protein whatever yeah we're

492
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
dehydrated protein whatever yeah we're
 

493
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,150
dehydrated protein whatever yeah we're
approaching the technology that is

494
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
approaching the technology that is
 

495
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,749
approaching the technology that is
absolutely out of sci-fi

496
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
absolutely out of sci-fi
 

497
