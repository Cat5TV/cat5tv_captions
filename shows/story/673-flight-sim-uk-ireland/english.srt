time
 

209
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,990
time
strangely enough we're able to play it

210
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
strangely enough we're able to play it
 

211
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,710
strangely enough we're able to play it
and

212

and
 

213
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,750
and
be immersed in that environment

214
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
be immersed in that environment
 

215
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,910
be immersed in that environment
at that time yeah because the technology

216
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
at that time yeah because the technology
 

217
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,750
at that time yeah because the technology
was not there to make it photo realistic

218
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
was not there to make it photo realistic
 

219
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,350
was not there to make it photo realistic
as it is right now but

220
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
as it is right now but
 

221
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,309
as it is right now but
so it's just unbelievable how the

222
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
so it's just unbelievable how the
 

223
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,990
so it's just unbelievable how the
progression of technology

224
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
progression of technology
 

225
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,789
progression of technology
changes our um our kind of our

226
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
changes our um our kind of our
 

227
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,710
changes our um our kind of our

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
being able to use satellite imagery has
 

317
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,790
being able to use satellite imagery has
evolved to the point where

318
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
evolved to the point where
 

319
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,830
evolved to the point where
they're able to use real photographs

320
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
they're able to use real photographs
 

321
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,469
they're able to use real photographs
from

322
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
from
 

323
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,909

talking about the old days of where they
 

329
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,870
talking about the old days of where they
had to program in these

330
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
had to program in these
 

331
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,510
had to program in these
vector graphics and and it looked

332
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
vector graphics and and it looked
 

333
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,110
vector graphics and and it looked
nothing like it does today

334
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
nothing like it does today
 

335
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,550
nothing like it does today
i mean obviously the technology wasn't

336
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
i mean obviously the technology wasn't
 

337
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,230
i mean obviously the technology wasn't
there but to think that a lot of the

338
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
there but to think that a lot of the
 

339
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,590
there but to think that a lot of the
gameplay is in fact

340
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
gameplay is in fact
 

341
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,990
gameplay is in fact
real we talk about photo realism but

342
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
real we talk about photo realism but
 

343
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,029
real we talk about photo realism but
it's actually

344
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
it's actually
 

345
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,150
it's actually

imagery
 

349
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,870
imagery
that's like super high resolution we're

350
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
that's like super high resolution we're
 

351
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,070
that's like super high resolution we're
talking 4k

352
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
talking 4k
 

353
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,230

gameplay which is wild and now they're

354
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
gameplay which is wild and now they're
 

355
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,110
gameplay which is wild and now they're
adding these

356
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
adding these
 

357
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,270
adding these
additional 3d elements so it goes to

358
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
additional 3d elements so it goes to
 

359
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,390
additional 3d elements so it goes to
show too that

360
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
show too that
 

361
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,670
show too that
um game development um has a kind of a

362
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
um game development um has a kind of a
 

363
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,510
um game development um has a kind of a
new process because we've never

364
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
new process because we've never
 

365
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,909
new process because we've never
i i know that over the past five six

366
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
i i know that over the past five six
 

367
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,230
i i know that over the past five six
years we've we've seen these kinds of

368
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
years we've we've seen these kinds of
 

369
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,909
years we've we've seen these kinds of
evolutions of games but looking back

370
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
evolutions of games but looking back
 

371
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,350
evolutions of games but looking back
further we never saw gameplay evolve

372
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
further we never saw gameplay evolve
 

373
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,070
further we never saw gameplay evolve
so much so that when you buy a game in

374
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
so much so that when you buy a game in
 

375
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,189
so much so that when you buy a game in
2020

376
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
2020
 

377
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,990
2020
the very next year you've got all these

378
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
the very next year you've got all these
 

379
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,189
the very next year you've got all these
enhancements like

380
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
enhancements like
 

381
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,150
enhancements like
what did becca say 43 gigabytes of

382
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
what did becca say 43 gigabytes of
 

383
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,029
what did becca say 43 gigabytes of
storage

384
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
storage
 

385
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,150
storage
it's massive um and the

386
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
it's massive um and the
 

387
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,909
it's massive um and the
so basically you could have flown it

388
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
so basically you could have flown it
 

389
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,270
so basically you could have flown it
three months ago

390
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
three months ago
 

391
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,430
three months ago
and now fly it again today and it's

392
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
and now fly it again today and it's
 

393
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,629
and now fly it again today and it's
completely evolved

394
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
completely evolved
 

395
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,070
completely evolved
yeah absolutely beautiful stuff now um

yeah absolutely beautiful stuff now um
 

397
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,150
yeah absolutely beautiful stuff now um
when they've placed all these elements

398
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
when they've placed all these elements
 

399
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,670
when they've placed all these elements
in the game

you
 

413
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,469
you
imagine if they continue to build this

414
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
imagine if they continue to build this

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
using that concept that development
 

419
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,510
using that concept that development
process and that up

420
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
process and that up
 

421
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,710
process and that up
update process in time it's just going

422

and so to be able to take that element
 

487
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,110
and so to be able to take that element
with

488
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
with
 

489
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,029
with
you know flight simulator and add in

490
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
you know flight simulator and add in
 

491
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,710
you know flight simulator and add in
things like you know your stonehenge and

492
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
things like you know your stonehenge and
 

493
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,589
things like you know your stonehenge and
all that kind of stuff

494
