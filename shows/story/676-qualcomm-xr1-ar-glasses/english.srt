what i love about this is that we've

204
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
what i love about this is that we've
 

205
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,350
what i love about this is that we've
seen attempts at ar

206
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
seen attempts at ar
 

207
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,550
seen attempts at ar
in the past and it's always

208
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
in the past and it's always
 

209
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,350
in the past and it's always
in my in my recollection it's always

210
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
in my in my recollection it's always
 

211
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,070
in my in my recollection it's always
been

212
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
been
 

213
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,949
been
trying to add augmented reality to our

214
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
trying to add augmented reality to our
 

215
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,149
trying to add augmented reality to our
existing environment

216
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
existing environment
 

217
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,190
existing environment
in such a way that it changes the

218
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
in such a way that it changes the
 

219
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,990
in such a way that it changes the
paradigm

220
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
paradigm
 

221
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,390
paradigm
of the user's interaction that's right

222
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
of the user's interaction that's right
 

223
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
of the user's interaction that's right
which if you think about it is is

224
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
which if you think about it is is
 

225
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,869
which if you think about it is is
interesting i mean ar is going to lead

226
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
interesting i mean ar is going to lead
 

227
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,910
interesting i mean ar is going to lead
to that

228
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
to that
 

229
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,270
to that
but i think because companies have been

230
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
but i think because companies have been
 

231
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,750
but i think because companies have been
driving to shift the paradigm

232
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
driving to shift the paradigm
 

233
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,869
driving to shift the paradigm
as they introduce the new technology

234
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
as they introduce the new technology
 

235
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,710
as they introduce the new technology
the adoption of that technology is poor

236
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
the adoption of that technology is poor
 

237
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,630
the adoption of that technology is poor
because users don't want to change

238
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
because users don't want to change
 

239
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,030
because users don't want to change
that's right yeah i don't want to change

240
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
that's right yeah i don't want to change
 

241
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,070
that's right yeah i don't want to change
but if you give me ar glasses that can

242
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
but if you give me ar glasses that can
 

243
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,110
but if you give me ar glasses that can
now

244
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
now
 

245
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,830
now
give me the same user interface the same

246
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
give me the same user interface the same
 

247
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,229
give me the same user interface the same
paradigm of taking my computer monitor

248
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
paradigm of taking my computer monitor
 

249
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,229
paradigm of taking my computer monitor
and placing it on the wall

250
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239

 

251
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,749

that to me makes sense so

252
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
that to me makes sense so
 

253
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,670
that to me makes sense so
i don't have to learn new ways to

254
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
i don't have to learn new ways to
 

255
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,510
i don't have to learn new ways to
control i don't have to

256
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
control i don't have to
 

257
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,310
control i don't have to
um you know like the ar that we've seen

258
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
um you know like the ar that we've seen
 

259
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,710
um you know like the ar that we've seen
so far has all been this whole shift in

260
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
so far has all been this whole shift in
 

261
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,230
so far has all been this whole shift in
the way that the interaction

262
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
the way that the interaction
 

263
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,310
the way that the interaction
occurs yeah but i'm still able to

264
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
occurs yeah but i'm still able to
 

265
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,230
occurs yeah but i'm still able to
control it just like my normal computers

266
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
control it just like my normal computers
 

267
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,629
control it just like my normal computers
right absolutely that's i mean the cool

you know augmented reality and it it
 

301
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,189
you know augmented reality and it it
does its

302
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
does its
 

303
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,590
does its
automated thing yeah this is fully

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
like a medical office for example so now
 

333
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,870
like a medical office for example so now
the the technician

334
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
the the technician
 

335
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,150
the the technician
can be working on a screen that

336
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
can be working on a screen that
 

337
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,189
can be working on a screen that
only they can see because it only

338
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
only they can see because it only
 

339
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,670
only they can see because it only
exists for that person that's wearing

340
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
exists for that person that's wearing
 

341
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,550
exists for that person that's wearing
those glasses

342
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
those glasses
 

343
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,830
those glasses
they don't have to worry about other

344
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
they don't have to worry about other
 

345
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,070
they don't have to worry about other
people seeing the the screen or anything

346
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
people seeing the the screen or anything
 

347
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,870
people seeing the the screen or anything
like that

348
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
like that
 

349
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,710
like that
um and and then qualcomm also kind of

350
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
um and and then qualcomm also kind of
 

351
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,469
um and and then qualcomm also kind of
goes on to say yes that's what we're

352
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
goes on to say yes that's what we're
 

353
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:00,950
goes on to say yes that's what we're
doing

354
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
doing
 

355
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,550
doing
but there's also going to be a certain

356
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
but there's also going to be a certain
 

357
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,990
but there's also going to be a certain
level of ar as well

358
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
level of ar as well
 

359
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,510
level of ar as well
yeah so then there will be that other

360
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
yeah so then there will be that other
 

361
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,950
yeah so then there will be that other
paradigm

362
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
paradigm
 

363
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,070
paradigm
available as maybe part of the software

364
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
available as maybe part of the software
 

365
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,629
available as maybe part of the software
as well

366
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
as well
 

367
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,670
as well
oh it makes sense so here's a great way

368
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
oh it makes sense so here's a great way
 

369
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,510
oh it makes sense so here's a great way
to use it but we may also

370
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
to use it but we may also
 

371
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,110
to use it but we may also
offer you some other things and it's

372
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
offer you some other things and it's
 

373
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,870
offer you some other things and it's
1080p times two

374
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
1080p times two
 

375
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,710
1080p times two
yeah which is great so we're going to

376
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
yeah which is great so we're going to
 

377
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,230
yeah which is great so we're going to
have good resolution it's going to be

378
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
have good resolution it's going to be
 

379
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,350
have good resolution it's going to be
